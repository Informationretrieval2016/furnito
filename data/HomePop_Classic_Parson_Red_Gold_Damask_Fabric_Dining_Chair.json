    "I bought a set of 4 to go with a mahogany-colored table. For those wondering about the color of the legs, they are a dark brown but they are not close to a black color - this was my concern after seeing the 'espresso' color, but they aren't too dark. These were not difficult to assemble at all. I noted the reviews about the holes being poorly drilled, but I found that if you put the 4 longest bolts in first and secure them tightly, the chair pieces shift into place so the other ones line up well enough to go in. Not perfect, but fine - I didn't have to drill new holes. To those who complained they were wobbly or uneven, I don't understand - there are adjustable casters on the legs which work perfectly to make them stable. Maybe these people didn't realize this. The fabric is not the greatest quality if you look at it closely, but the pattern actually hides this, and they look good at the table - passable for higher quality chairs. They aren't uncomfortable to sit on, though the cushioning isn't great and shifts a bit when you sit. They aren't designed for hours of sitting in a row, anyway. Overall, these were a good deal for the price. I found them to be in line with the other reviews - colors are rusty reds and oranges, they look pretty at the table, and were fairly easy to assemble.", 
    "These chairs are very stylish. The color is more rust/orange paisley with red and gold accents which is apparent in the picture. The quality is decent for the price and the chairs were pretty easy to assemble and seem to be sturdy. I'm happy.", 
    "These chairs were sold out when I first found them on Overstock. I found a similar chair in a brick and mortar store for TWICE the price. I had set up an email notification on Overstock to let me know if these chairs became available again. Right as I was grudgelingly going to buy the brick and mortar store ones, I got the email from Overstock these were back in stock! Super fast delivery and easy assembly and we are dining like royalty with these divine chairs!", 
    "A friend recommended Overstock.com when I was having trouble finding dining room furniture for a small apartment after downsizing from a 4-bedroom house. I was skeptical but took a look. When I saw these chairs, I realized I found what I had been unable to find in the furniture stores. I was unsure about not trying them out before ordering but my friend assured me that sending them back was not a problem if necessary. They arrived without a glitch and are exactly what I pictured and comfortable as well! I am so pleased! The day after I ordered them I went ahead and ordered a table as well., They all arrived the same day and look PERFECT in the apartment! I had read the reviews before purchasing and that helped make my decision to purchase as well. The color is EXACTLY what I wanted!! Thank you so much!", 
    "These chairs are as beautiful around my dining table as they are in the on-line picture. The colors are true to the on-line representation and are exactly what I was looking for. The chairs are sturdy and comfortable, and constructed with only a minimum of hassle. I am very pleased and am looking forward to our next dinner party.", 
    "It's a good deal for the price but in this instance you get what you pay for. They seem sturdy but the cushion has a weird squeak, resistance and hard shell collapse kind of sound/feel to it when you sit down. It's like a padded plastic shell that collapses on itself when sitting. But they are pretty to look at. I only paid **** total for both as a set. So they will work for filing the space at the table for now but I do plan on replacing them in a few months.", 
    "The fabric is very nice quality and the colors are exactly as represented in the picture. The colors are perfect with the Tony Bahama tablecloth. Easy to assemble sits...level and comfortable. I couldn't be more pleased. The only thing I would criticize is the foot protectors. They are rubber and won't slide on carpet. Who would know I would have carpet instead of bare floors.", 
    "These are great. I got 4 and am ordering two more. They do require assembly, and missing a couple of the tips on the legs but they are sophisticated, comfortable and understated. Just love them.", 
    "These parson chairs are so my favorite things. They were initially my second choice during my search on overstock.com. I initially wanted red only chairs, but my husband saw them and thought they were nice. I liked them, but from the picture, the chairs looked more gold than red and I wanted more red than anything else. Well, I ordered them and much to my surprise, they were perfect!! I was so happy with the color mix. These chairs were actually more red than gold and I love them. They are so comfortable to sit on, even after sitting for a while. Also, the assembly was a cinch, my husband put all four chairs together in about 45 minutes. They look so rich and for the price, I hadn't seen anything else that could compare with my specifications. I would recommend them to anyone that asks. Very Happy Customer", 
    "When these chairs first arrived I was thrilled with them. They look similar to the picture and even nicer in person. They were easy to assemble and sturdy when put together. They are also very comfortable and don't look cheap. However, after about one year, the cushions are now falling apart. I only weigh 100 pounds, so I don't think it's me. The seats have completely lost their shape and flattened on two of the chairs. The other two are beginning to do the same thing. I am so disappointed. I wish I had spent a bit more money and went with better quality chairs and I recommend you do the same.", 
    "Nice chairs. It is critical to be sure the screws are all started and lined up before trying to tighten them", 
    "These chairs are nice and they are comfortable. They are exactly what I expected.", 
    "I've been on the hunt for chairs for breakfast room for a few months now. Then I found these and the hunt is over!! They arrived quickly. It didn't take my husband long to put all four together. They are quite comfortable and appear to be built really well. The price was great too, especially compared to what I was finding in the big box stores.", 
    "Chairs were easy to assemble (I didn't do it, my husband did). They look beautiful. I will probably spray a scotch guard on them to preserve the fabric which may not hold up super well to spot washing. They are very comfortable and feel quite sturdy.", 
    "This is a beautiful chair. Very rich looking. Colors are subdued and sophisticated. I was surprised to receive a quality chair for the low price. The construction is sturdy. I am very pleased to receive such an impressive chair! I use it at my writing desk and it is very comfortable.", 
    "I order this chair on a Tuesday Eveniong and received it on Thursday. I could not believe how fast it arrived. By Friday it was together and at my table desk. I just love it!!! I put this together by myself, and I am a 72 year young lady. Everyone who see this cannot believe the price & the quality. Thank You O.co!!", 
    "Looks very Nice, Poor quality material, so legs can crack if the chair is rocked...", 
    "I love this chair. Expensive lookimg in my Florida room. Easy to assemble.", 
    "great price and very comfortable item with good shipping and easy assembly . would order again.", 
    "Well packaged but the quality is just so so. They look nice! However the legs have varying wood tone, so I had to mix and match and put the best one facing the living room and the worst backing to a wall. The fabric is nice, but it has raw edges where it is stapled to the frame, instead of being folded over. Hey for the price you don't expect miracles but I was expecting a bit more.", 
    "Chair leg broke within 6 mo. Not a good purchase.", 
    "Really are a lot better looking than the pictures. Made my formal dining room pop! Love the chairs", 
    "I am very happy with my new chairs. They are of good quality, and the colors are just as they appear on the web site. They were pretty easy to put together, and add a bit of color in our dining area.", 
    "One of the springs somehow came unattached and ripped through the bottom of the chair.", 
    "The chair was the exact color as displayed. The quality is average; however the price is right. Although the chair came with the wrong size of screws, customer care was attentive and apologetic. The proper size was sent by mail within a few days.", 
    "Very nice chairs, true to color and very sturdy.", 
    "Needed 2 more dining chairs, this pair coordinated with faux brown leather and red parson chairs (previous overstock purchase). Comfortable, pattern is subtle, fit my needs.", 
    "I love this chair. It looks beautiful and was easy to put together. It looks so nice in my dining room. I have had it for over 3 years and it still looks new. I got it as extra seating to sit in the corner of the room. Very Happy with this purchase!", 
    "I had 2 similar skirted chairs and needed some more for my table in the breakfast room. These are a very close match and I absolutely love them. Just one little problem..one had the wrong screws and hardware but we managed to find some to use locally.", 
    "Quality and comfort much better than expected. Just ordered four more.", 
    "A bit lightweight but sturdy and thickly cushioned. Looks great at my kitchen table. Would recommend!", 
    "love the qualityof the fabric; easy to put together; looks great at my table", 
    "Love the pattern & a smart looking piece, but flimsy chair. Better for show or accent rather than daily use.", 
    "Beautiful chairs! I ordered 6, then added two more. They completely changed the look of my dining room. So rich and expensive looking. Comfortable, too. Not too difficult to assemble. I imagine with the pattern that a spill won't be devastating. Great choice. Get them!", 
    "It took a little long to come and the tracking was inaccurate. But one phone call to Overstock and it came the next day. I use it for my vanity desk and i looovveee it!!", 
    "Hi my name is mike I have been looking for chairs for the last three months, I have been pretty much on every sight I could think of looking for chairs to fit my decor for the holidays after searching I came up with nothing I liked from all the other websites, And then I hit on overstock.

    "It was easy to put together and comfortable.", 
    "Chair were pretty nothing to put them together with.", 
    "Decent quality for a great price! Not for everyday use but great for a dining room that's not used that often", 
    "Love the fabric and size of this chair. Legs are a little wobbly but I was able to adjust them. Fast Shipping with no damage to chairs:)", 
    "Arrived quickly, easy to put together, comfortable and very pretty! I'm a bit worried about quality, as these had some loose/hanging threads and sewing issues (though they don't detract from the look). So far so good after 1 month, but time will tell.", 
    "One leg was a tad shorter than the others, but for $$ I can't really complain. Other than that, it looks good.", 
    "Could not be more pleased. .....they are beautiful and fit the room perfectly.......even at twice the price I would have been happy.....at this cost, i'm ecstatic.", 
    "I ordered as a desk chair for a small space. Like it so much that I plan on ordering another!", 
    "The chairs are sturdy but light. great look and quality. Easy to assemble", 
    "Purchased a few of these chairs a couple of years ago, needed more, and the fabric dye lot matched perfectly with the older chairs. And, though they were due to arrive the day after Thanksgiving, they arrived the day before! No folding chairs necessary for turkey day!", 
    "Sturdy and easy to assemble!", 
    "Very Sturdy reliable to sit on", 
    "the fabric is nice.... used in an office", 
    "We almost bought another chair at a store for three times the price. Thankfully we held off and got this chair instead. Great chair for a great price.", 
    "I just love love the chairs not hard to put together . I love the color It took me about an hour and a half to do all 4 chair but I need my son-in-law to tighten up the screws for me .", 
    "The chairs look great - the only issue is that they are not very comfortable. The seat has some odd padding.For the price they are OK", 
    "These are perfect for my office/music rehearsal room. I use one for my desk and one for practicing guitar.", 
    "This chair has the most beautiful fabric. I bought this chair because I had hip pain. This is the most comfortable chair. The pattern and color blends in nicely with the other kitchen table chairs. Would definitely buy again.", 
    "Very pleased with the 4 chairs. Easy to put together. Lightweight, but thats what we wanted. They look very nice with our circular glass table.", 
    "Purchased 4 chairs based upon fairly consistent reviews. Was not disappointed. Sturdy, attractive chairs and good value. Look great at our dining table. Color and pattern exactly as depicted on screen. Easy to assemble; screw in the legs. Well packaged and timely delivery.", 
    "A little on the light side as far as the weight goes.", 
    "Arrived on schedule, good quality, sturdy but lightweight.", 
    "We bought these when we moved house to modernize our dining room set. We bought contrasting carver chairs and these are a great addition. They are comfortable and practical.", 
    "Look nice, fabric nice, comfy. A little light. We put soft tabs on feet so they would slide easier.", 
    "Chairs were not hard to assemble. They are beautiful and look great with my dining room table.", 
    "The fabric is very rich looking, and it blends well with the furniture I already have in my living/dining area. The chairs look as good as chairs I looked at in furniture stores for more than twice the price. It took a while to figure out the best way to assemble the chairs, but they went together easily after practicing on the first one. I would highly recommend these chairs.", 
    "I LOVE these Chairs, they are true to the color as shown in the picture, they are comfortable & well made. They were very easy to assemble. Everyone that comes in my home say they are beautiful. I'm SO happy I purchased them.", 
    "I love the fabric; easy to assemble.", 
    "Beautiful chair. I used it for an occasional chair instead of a dining chair. Good price but fell apart in a year. Maybe good for a dining set that you only use very occasionally.", 
    "These are really nice chairs and very comfrtable. I also like the fact that ever leg has an adjustable screw-out footing. They take a little time to build each one, but after you do a couple they're easy to build. Just take your time and make sure you don't cross thread the fasteners.", 
    "...Not all that comfy. Very stiff...good for a guest with back problems. Maybe it will work-in with more use. Looks beautiful and took about 20 minutes to assemble (mid-60s woman here).", 
    "we bought these chairs for our dining room. They are comfortable and stylish. The pattern is exactly as pictured in the images.", 
    "The chairs are beautiful, decent weight and nice fabric. And the price was lovely. Out next choice for Parson's chairs came in at $$$ per chair and delivery (from North Carolina) was another $$$ so these were a welcome find.Some assembly required when they arrived but they went together relatively easily. The only con and the reason they didn't get 5 stars is the furniture leg caps. The caps appear to be heavy plastic but you know they will crack. We know we will have to replace them which brings me to the second problem.The leg caps are attached to the legs by screwing them into a small opening in the center of the leg. The \"casing\" that the leg cap screws into is part of one piece of metal hammered into the chair leg. Not all of the metal pieces are evenly hammered in so, on 2 of the 6 chairs we bought, the legs are not even. Backing the metal piece out of the chair leg will be time consuming and a bit risky, but my husband says it's the only way to fix the issue.Would I buy them again? Yes....even knowing that the leg caps have to be swapped out because the chairs are solid and the fabric is beautiful.", 
    "Chair was a nice addition to my great room. The colors were pretty, Only complain is that the seat was rather hard and not as comfortable as I like.", 
    "Looks great. Easy to assemble. Fabric held up. What you'd expect for this price.", 
    "Great bargain for the price and nice looking too.", 
    "High quality, beautiful color combination, what a steal! They change the entire look of my dining room, from plain to elegant.", 
    "There is assembly and one didn't line up so my husband worked on it but they look beautiful. The color is exactly like the picture and the legs can be adjusted if the floor is uneven. Great Buy! I ordered two more. Very comfortable even for big guys!", 
    "Arrived quickly and was exactly as pictured. Easy to assemble, sturdy, and just what I needed. Thanks!", 
    "Naturally you get what you pay for. The Chair looks very nice, and It iscomfortable enough. But it is cheaply made, and not perfect. But for what I wanted it for, I am very happy", 
    "Chairs arrived in just a few days. Easy to assemble. Perfect match with my tile floors. two of the six chairs had off-center pattern, but other than that, I am very pleased with the purchase.", 
    "Material and design are good. Chair is easy to tip and seat is lumpy to my 5'3\" frame. Easy to assemble. A very reasonable investment if you need a modern look with a tradition pattern.", 
    "I have a dining room that is painted gold. I refinished a table and needed chairs for this room. These are beautiful in person and look wonderful in my room with red curtains! I am enormously pleased with this purchase!", 
    "Bought these chairs to go around my round dining table - wood legs match the wood in my table and they are comfortable & beautiful AND you can't beat the price!! I have six!", 
    "Beautiful but not as sturdy as expected. Probably needs some adjustment.", 
    "Love it. Love the colors. So excited to finish my dining room now.", 
    "We needed nice fabric chairs on a budget, and these fit the bill! They are a bit shiny because of the \"jacquard\" fabric, but it is an embroidered fabric and not a print, and they're not tacky-shiny, just a bit of shimmer. They match our mahogany table perfectly and are sturdy and comfortable.", 
    "Theses are very comfortable and quick to assemble ! Very happy with... So much so I bought 2 more!!", 
    "This chair is easy to assemble and the color is great for my Southwest decor. They are comfortable to sit on, as well.",

    "Bought this chair for a small desk area. Great height, comfortable, and easy to assemble.", 
    "The chair was easy to assemble and looks beautiful with my other furniture. The price was less than comparable chairs at the furniture store.", 
    "I love the chair it was exactly what I was looking for. The color is pretty true to the picture with a little more brick rather than red. They are very comfortable and look very elegant .I was able to put them together very easily with the tolls provided. I would recommend these chairs.", 
    "Easy to assemble. Good quality.", 
    "Very happy with this chair. ::Looks great and good quality for the price.", 
    "Love this chair! So easy to assemble. It is of such high quality, that it looks like we bought it in a fancy furniture store. The chair is well made, sturdy and beautiful! Color is more of an orange-red, then a true red.", 
    "When I first orderd the chairs I thought they were a solid color They actually have a tich paisley design which is oulined in gold. They are elgant and easy to assemble. My dining table has never been so formal. Love them", 
    "Bought 2 to replace captains chairs on our old dining set. Very comfortable and the colors are true to the web pictures. Easy to assemble.", 
    "I Loved it so much I bought 2. They look great together..", 
    "Beautiful fabric, solid chair, excellent price. Exactly as described. I have enjoyed this at my kitchen desk.", 
    "OK for the price. Pattern is very pretty ...but the color comes off as an orangy red.they still look nice. Easy to put together. One chair came with a split leg..didn't feel Like going thru the return thing.. Epoxy and a vise clamp", 
    "I bought this chair to use at a computer desk as my husband was complaining about the old chair we had been using. This one came quickly and I had it assembled within 20 minutes. The cushioning is nice, but I do feel like it's not going to last overly long. After a few weeks of solid use, it's not as high as it used to be. But, for the price, I really like this chair. The colors look great with chocolate brown leather as my other pieces in the room.", 
    "THE PRICE WAS EXCELLENT. THE COLORS MATCHED MY COLOR SCHEME IN BEDROOM. I MADE A LITTLE READING NOOK WITH THE CHAIR, SMALL SIDE TABLE AND FLOOR LAMP. I LOVE IT. ASSEMBLY TOOK ABOUT 2O MINUTES. CHAIR IS WELL MADE AND VERY COMFORTABLE.", 
    "Loved the chair but didn't like it wth my colors to me looked more orange than red but very pretty! I returned them and ordered a plain beige chair. Your won't be unhappy if you order them and they go with your colors!", 
    "I wasn't sure about the colors of the chair but it is perfect for our room. It was easy to put together and I received it much faster than I I expected. Very pleased with it.", 
    "These chairs fit my purpose for decoration but are not very comfortable to sit on, the foam padding is to rounded. My overall experience with this purchase was great. One chair came damaged and Overstock.com work very quickly to correct this problem.", 
    "These are very inexpensive chairs but they do look great in my formal dining room. I don't think these chairs would last very long if used on a daily basis but my dining room gets used infrequently so they're perfect.", 
    "Beautiful chair and you can't go wrong with the price. Well made and a great value.", 
    "I ordered four chairs for my dining room table. The fabric is beautiful and very elegant. The seats are thick and very comfortable. These chairs go very nicely in my dining room. I ordered two more! The legs are a nice brown--not too dark and not too light, similar to chocolate. Assembly was easy, but on two of the chairs, four main screws did not fit the holes. I will need some help to finish the job. On one of the chairs, the thick seat cushion sound like your sitting on a seat stuffed with plastic grocery bags. It's not too noticeable, but there is a sound of plastic when you get up from the chair. The fabric is a red/gold and believe it or not, my large vase with orange silk flowers makes the perfect centerpiece. The details of the stitching on the back of the chair is very elegant. For the money, this chair is a great value. As I mentioned before, I ordered two more chairs as my round table was big enough to handle six seats instead of four. Lastly, you do not need your own tools to assemble, except if you have screw issues like the one I described above. I recommend this chair.", 
    "Great pattern, easy assembly seems sturdy.", 
    "I love the look, soft muted colors.", 
    "I was hesitant to purchase six chairs on faith that the color was true to description. Not only is the color great but the assembly was easy as well. As to the quality, I have very damaged back and can sit comfortably on these chairs. My husband is 6'3 and he is comfortable as well. A win win for us. So happy.", 
    "We needed upholstered dining room chairs to. \"warm up\" a room. These chairs exceeded our execrations. We ordered eight chairs, which arrived promptly. They were easy to assemble and add elegance to the room.", 
    "easy to put together.very nice looking and comfortable.big size for large people.", 
    "Ordered 4 of these to begin with to see if we liked them and quickly ordered 4 more once we checked them out. Nice, solid chairs that are comfortable and look great.", 
    "Excellent. It matches my dining room decor perfectly. The cushion is not too soft but it is worth it for the price.", 
    "These are nice, easy to assemble chairs. The fabric is as advertised. Cushioning feels a little cheap, so everyday use might be a problem. But the price is right for these lovely, decorative chairs!", 
    "I had been looking for new dining room chairs for several months. When I saw these I knew they would be perfect. The colors were true to what was pictured and they sit a bit higher than those they were replacing. The directions for assembling were easy to understand. There's no doubt that we made a very comfortable choice.", 
    "these chairs are wonderful, their color are so lovely, the red is not a bright red just the right color to match the gold, so happy i got them, and i had them fixed in less then a hour.they really made a great change to my dining area.", 
    "easily assembled and looks very nice. definitely worth the price", 
    "chair has nice design but wasn't made as well as what I would have liked to see", 
    "Happily surprised with the chairs when delivered. Very nice fabric and colors, comfortable and fashionable. Will more than likely order two more.", 
    "I was surprised I had to put them together myself. They are attractive but not really fine furniture. The fabric is very attractive.", 
    "The chairs are very stylish. They seem to be sturdy at this point. They were easy to assemble and had all of the needed tools. I would suggest that the description should not say that they came assembled as that is not accurate.", 
    "I bought these chairs to use in my new kitchen with an antique table and a built in desk. The color is exactly what I expected. They are comfortable and were easy to assemble. I was afraid they would look cheap with the inexpensive price, but I am thrilled with them.", 
    "returned it was not assembled as it said / called customer service and told them", 
    "the chairs came fast, and were easy to put together. i like everything about them.", 
    "Some lights make it look tacky and some make it look elegant. It's okay for the price Easy to assemble.", 
    "Beautiful, can trust the color you see when you order. Solid structure. Easy to put together after you learn how to do the first one. Just need to scotch guard them. I am very pleased!-judie", 
    "I am so impressed. They are perfect! And fast delivery!!!! Easy to assemble and amazing for the price! In fact I am ordering more now!", 
    "I ordered these and my son put them together. The pattern is a very subtle, very lovely red/gold filagree that looks perfect in my dining room. The cushioning is good, the seats are very comfortable. The chairs came together very easily and were up in no time. The shipment came quickly no problems. I am very pleased with my purchase. Great product, excellent price!", 
    "These chairs are beautiful and look just as I wanted them to in my dining room, mixed with wooden chairs. Great price as well.", 
    "The chairs arrived in a timely fashion and were super easy to put together (I was surprised, actually, and I am no assembly goddess). They are very comfortable to sit on and look beautiful. For the price, which is fabulous, they are amazing! I've had people say that they look like they came from a high end furniture store. They are the perfect size and color and I couldn't be happier!", 
    "I needed a single chair for a small desk in my bedroom. The chair is sturdy but light and the material complements my d\u00e9cor. Great buy. Was also very easy to assemble.", 
    "We purchased eight of these and for the price they are really pretty. The fabric is nice and they seem cushiony. However, 3 out of the 6 we've put together so far have uneven legs, even after adjusting them, and they just seem to be very cheaply made. Not sure how they'll last in the long term.", 
    "THESE GORGEOUS CHAIRS COMPLIMENT MY LITTLE DINING ROOM TABLE PERFECTLY. MY KITCHEN HAS ACCENTS OF RED SO I WANTED THESE CHAIRS TO PICK UP ON THAT COLOR. THE RED IS NOT OUTSTANDING BUT JUST ENOUGH TO MAKE THESE CHAIRS PERFECT FOR MY COLOR SCHEME. THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY COMFORTABLE TOO - GREAT PADDING IN THE SEATS. THANK YOU OVERSTOCK.COM. I WILL BE A CUSTOMER FOREVER!", 
    "Seem to be sturdy and they are very pretty and comfortable to sit in. Easy to put together", 
    "The fabric is sturdy and attractive. The style would complement a semi-formal dining room. The chair is comfortable. The only aspect to note is that the chair seat is not the width and depth which the description on overstock says it is. It is a smaller, narrower seat than described.", 
    "Was hunting for a chair for my desk to match a room done in reds and golds/yellows. This chair totally fit the bill. It was the perfect height. Was together in 15 minutes. Just remember, there are adjusters on the bottoms of the legs, so there should be no reason the chair should \"rock\" or be uneven. Just adjust the disks until the chair is level. Would definately buy another one.", 
    "Other than the assembly required these chairs are awesome! The fabric is beautiful and they are very comfortable.", 
    "We priced more expensive chairs for our kitchen table, but these looked great online. We ordered one for a trial and loved it, so we ordered 3 more. Excellent service and simple construction. Seem to be made of good fabric and wood materials. Very comfortable. I would recommend this product.", 
    "This chair is lovely to look at and so comfortable. I cannot believe I got such a well made chair so inexpensively. It is richly padded and looks like a high end product. It is the focal point for my sitting room. What amazed me was the fabric. The colors are rich and vibrant, but fits well into my color scheme. It might be described as red, but is such an amazing shade of red it fits into other color schemes so well. However, I do not like to put things together. Being handicapped this is a difficult process. But I got help, just because this was such an amazing chair. If you want to get the most amazing chair ever, take a chance with assembling it. It is worth the time you will invest. Having spent months hunting for this chair locally, I cannot tell you how happy I am with this little gem.", 
    "I looked all over the internet and was about to buy some Jennifer T. chairs for almost $300 each. I found these on sale, and all four cost less than one of the other chairs. These are beautiful and well constructed! The fabric is breathtaking, and assembly was a breeze. Super-fast shipping was a plus!", 
    "These chairs are amazing for the price, great quality and they look fantastic in my nook area. They compare to Pier1 quality just cheaper!", 
    "These chairs are beautiful and are true to what the page shows. Bought two and liked them so much, bought two more.", 
    "I'm so happy I ordered these chairs instead of going out and buying them from a store and having to pay for delivery or having to load them into the truck of my car and unload them. They were delivered right to my door!!!!!! Love you.... Overstock.com !!!!!", 
    "pretty easy to put together, took only about 10 minutes. Comfortable, looks great with our desk.", 
    "This is a nice chair with decent padding. I was disappointed to see it came disassembled since the search I did was for assembled chairs. I did read the reviews and saw people did have to screw them together. I thought perhaps the item changed or something and was no offered put together. Either way it does not take long to put them together. The wood frame of the seat is cheap wood but not press board. The legs have leveling pegs on each in case either the chair legs are off or you have an uneven floor so that is nice. i'm not sure how well they will hold up but its good that they are there. The seat is well padded and the fabric is really nice. For the price I think it was a decent deal. I wouldn't pay more than I paid for these so If you get a discount or deal on them go for it. They fit the bill but I'm not sure how durable they will be long term.", 
    "I loved the fabric colors but the wood legs were not a dark brown espresso or chocolate wood, it was more of a cherry finish which clashed with my darker table. The product itself was of excellent quality, the description of the wood was off. There is always a chance of items not matching when you purchase something off the internet so these kind of things should be expected. I just returned all 6 chairs and should get a full refund.", 
    "I am very happy with the color and the quality of these chairs. And you can't beat the price. The wood legs match my \"tobacco\" table perfectly. Lovely", 
    "First of all, I fell in love with these chairs; after several discussions with my husband; we decided to purchase only one chair seeing that we weren't able to find out the comfort of the chair. Now that we sat upon it, we will be purchasing 3 more chairs to complete my new DR! Perfect, but the back of the chair should be visible to us online. It has beautiful piped finished edge to complete the look. I was so happy to see this, not knowing what it was going to look like from the back. It matches my table on 2 expresso wood chairs like it was meant to be.", 
    "I have been looking for fabric parsons chairs to modernize my dining room set. I purchased 4 chairs to add to my grandmothers mahogany dining table. My husband had no issues with putting them together. The colors are gorgeous and the chairs are comfortable. An added bonus is the piping trim on the back of the chair! I hadn't noticed that from the picture. It makes the chair look more expensive. I'm thrilled with these chairs!", 
    "Would recommend chairs. Buying two more. Legs perfect match for my dining room table", 
    "Beautiful chairs, color is perfect not bright. Chair is nicely made, and a great deal for the price.", 
    "This is a great buy...I added two of these to my 4-chair kitchen set, so now I have 6 chairs with the two parsons at the head and bottom of my table. It actually makes my whole set look bigger. We just love the modern look that it gave our very traditional kitchen. Very easy to assemble also.", 
    "Nice chairs, bought them for thanksgiving, my family loved them.", 
    "These are great chairs- stylish and modern. Ordered them just in time for my Thanksgiving meal and got so many compliments on them. Comfortable and fairly easy to put together. Would recommend them to anyone!", 
    "I like the color with my decor. Chairs are pretty well made and structurally good. One of the springs in a seat cushion looks a little popped up, but not that noticeable. I opted not to send it back. Hoping it will go down once we sit on them enough. They aren't being used everyday for right now with a remodel going on.", 
    "I was looking for some fabric Parsons chairs to update my newly remodeled dining room. These are perfect! They complete the room and add a pop of color without being overbearing. My husband added Scotch Guard to better protect the fabric. We love the chairs and my \"eye for design & color\" daughter was equally impressed with my selection. Overstock delivered in less than 1 week from the time I placed my order -- with NO tax and NO shipping! Love it!!!", 
    "I ordered two of these chairs to have extra seating at my recent dinner party. Unofrtunately, instead of receiving the two chairs that I ordered, I received one chair and some kind of a buld it yourself end table. I would like to have that item picked up, and the ordered chair delivered. Unfortunately, it is too late for my party, but I believe that overstock should rectify this mistake. The chair is good quality for casual dining (in this case outdoors.)", 
    "We bought a dining table in the clearance section of a furniture store and had been searching for some chairs to match with no luck. I found these and thought they'd work. Not only do they work, but they look Beautiful with our table!!! I'm glad I kept searching and found a fabric chair instead of trying to match a wood one. It's a gorgeous set now!! Our only complaint is that one of the chairs has a fabric flaw right on the top of the back part, but it's not a huge deal! These chairs are VERY sturdy and comfortable!", 
    "Great value for the price. i would recommend. Good looks for budget minded people.", 
    "These chairs look fab in my condo and they are very comfy. The instructions for assembly are a bit of a challenge as it was all pictures, no text explanation, but my Dad figured it out...it took us 2 hours...Dad did three in the time it took Mom and me to do one!", 
    "I would not recommend ordering furniture from overstock. The table I also ordered had chips in it.", 
    "Love these chairs. Purchased them to update dining room. They add a nice pop of color without being overpowering. Color is as appears. The red combined with gold gives a little of a burnt orange. Very elegant."
