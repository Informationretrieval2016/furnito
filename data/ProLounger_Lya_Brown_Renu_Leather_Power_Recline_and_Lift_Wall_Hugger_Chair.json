    "Since lift chairs are used for persons with mobility issues, I WOULD NOT recommend this product.It is very light weight. If you move in the seat toward the footrest while the footrest is extended,the chair tips over. It tips to the point the back of the chair lifts off the floor and the person who is sitting in it slides to the floor. The person I am referring to weighs less than 125 pounds.The EMT's were called to get my mother out of the floor. It is comfortable to sit in.", 
    "Would recommend, but only if the person is not tall. My friend is over six foot tall and this chair is by know means for him. His head sticks out above the top of the back of the chair. His feet hang over the leg rest.. Yes it looks good and works good, but when you see 300 lbs, you would think that it would work for a tall person. Not pleased at all and this is not a reason for free return. So think twice before ordering.", 
    "My husband is disabled-military, and has problems standing up. This was a great help and he loves it. Has even slept in it the first night we got it.", 
    "Bought 2 of these chairs, 1 for mom, and 1 for dad. The chair has two buttons on remote up and recline which seem to confuse them both but over all a hit. Light weight, washable and powerful. I would recommend it.", 
    "Great price with easy assembly and use of controller.", 
    "My husband just had spinal surgery and i searched for hours looking for a chair to help him. This chair checks all the boxes: bush of a button for ease to stand up or sit down, reclines to a completely reclined position, quite, well build, and assembly, took 2 minutes! myself and my friend put this together, just match 2 prongs and your done! The chair takes minimal space and truly only needs 4 inches from a wall - amazing purchase - thank you Overstock, my husband loves his new chair!", 
    "Very sturdy ...does it's job well. Will recommend to all", 
    "Bought this for my elderly father. Easy to assemble and works easily.", 
    "Quality chair fits our needs fast shipping", 
    "My husband loves his lift recliner chair.", 
    "I ordered this chair for my mom who just had knee replacement surgery. It was perfect immediately after coming home to assist with sitting until she got full flexibility in her legs. She felt comfortable enough that she fell asleep in it a couple of times. It looks good and works perfectly. Super easy to assemble, just heavy.", 
    "We got 2 and just love them. A great addition to our bedroom.", 
    "They love it. Helps him getting up with his limited strength,", 
    "Excellent chair, made well for larger people. Plus, the faux leather upholstery looks very nice, is soft and soil easily wipes off. Couldn't ask for more! We bought two and are delighted with our purchase.", 
    "Great chair - easy to assemble and very comfortable", 
    "Pleased with product and delivery service.", 
    "I got this for my wife who has Dementia and getting up off the sofa has become a problem. This recliner is perfect. I don't have to pull her up and hurt my back, it is a life saver. It tilts her just enough to a standing position and she can get up by herself. The chair is comfortable to sit in and it looks great too. I put the chair together in 5 minutes. It came wrapped well. I highly recommend this chair!", 
    "This chair is very comfortable and the the \"leather\" is very soft.", 
    "My husband has a bad back sciatica & loves this chair!", 
    "but I'm so disappointed on d quality of the material. not even 2wks my dad has been using it for shorts periods of time and its already looking like is torn @ d edges on d back....this is too expensive for it to have such bad material. will think about it twice before I shop here again...", 
    "Exactly as described. Arrived quickly, in great condition. Is very comfortable for my mother in law and for her needs. Thank you for a great deal.", 
    "Very good chair for the money.Easy to set up and operate.", 
    "Have been using several days with my handicapped mother. It is a bit noisy but works well for the price.", 
    "Great product. I purchesed this for my mother,she is 95,she loces the chair.", 
    "came on time well packed and easy to assemble", 
    "Delivery could be improved. This chair was left on my doorstep and it was very difficult to get it up the threshold step into the house and into the room to set it up.Once in place, I was able to get it out of the box, attach the back and set up the electric control. The chair needs to be near an outlet so the cord can be plugged in for the control to work. The cord can go to the front or back or side. The cord attaches to the right side of the chair. I am concerned about the durability of the fabric. My husband has Parkinson's and finds the chair comfortable. It has the electronic control that moves the chair to an upright angle so it can lift him up out of the chair allowing him to get out of the chair and stand more easily. He can also recline and has fallen asleep in the chair.", 
    "I've thought about a similar chair for years. I am very happy I finally decided to buy one. Easy assembly and easy to use the r emote control. Very comfortable, too.", 
    "My Mother loves her new recliner.It was so easy to put together. I am so happy with the product and would recommend it to anyone of age.Thanks!", 
    "This chair was purchased for a terminal ill relative who no longer had the strength to push himself up from the soft fabric sofa he was using. He refused a hospital bed for several reasons with the most important being how he labored to breath when lying down. The ProLounger leather power recliner has made it easier to for him to stand even though he still requires assistance once he is standing. It is comfortable enough for him to sleep in without struggling for every breath. This chair has made his life better in addition to being a great help for his caregiver.", 
    "Bought this for my dad, who recently was admitted to a nursing home. He loves it & so do all his neighbors", 
    "Bought for my mother. She is absolutely loving it.", 
    "This is the first chair that I can actually sleep soundly for two hours in it. The positions, labeled infinite all positions, is the most valuable option. It is great for aching joints and sensitive muscles, because the electric control allows you to change any part that affects your body, without you having to move, and relieves any pressure points. I wanted a light tan color, but I will settle for this dark brown, just for the comfort it has given to me. About the control -- it is unusually quiet and works easily. Does not disturb anyone else sitting in the room. Only one drawback. The control does not have a battery back-up for power outages. The price was a good buy at Overstock.com. $$$. The fabric is genuine leather, very overstuffed, but soft. and not cold in winter. The footrest is well padded and gives good support to legs and feet. A great chair for anyone who is ill and disabled.", 
    "works great and is very comfortable", 
    "My lounger arrived early, only two minutes to assemble. Very comfortable !!!", 
    "Excellent power recliner. Great for the elderly!!", 
    "This chair was an excellent choice for my mother.She loves it and it's easier for her to get out the chair now.", 
    "My father is elderly and has recently been hospitalized and is on blood thinners. Any fall can be fatal. In one week he fell while getting out of this chair. It is not sturdy or evenly balanced. We were very lucky he did not sustain a serious injury. I have called to return the chair. The first customer service lady was lovely and said that she would send a box to return the chair in. The box arrived and it was too small. I used life chat to let them know. An agent going by the name of Stone was most unhelpful and said that they would not supply a box for the return. Now what do I do?? I am stuck with a dangerous chair and no way to return it. Not great customer service at this point. I will keep trying. Please don't buy this if you love your parent or debilitated person. Its just not safe.", 
    "My father is 85 years old and has a difficult time going from the sitting position to the standing position. This chair has made a significant improvement in his quality of life. He is able to get out of the chair with no assistance, and is not exhausted after trying to struggle to his feet.This chair is silent, and the movement is very fluid. I also like the heavy duty motors which are rated at 300 pounds vs the 250 pounds you find on most lift chairs. This was the perfect Christmas gift for my Father.", 
    "Bought for my grandmother who had knee surgery. This helps her get up easily without putting a lot of pressure/weight on her knees like she did with her old recliner", 
    "mom 83 yr old mother loves it. It even reclines with button. awsome", 
    "Love this recliner! Very comfortable and easy to operate. The lift option is awesome!", 
    "Bought for my 86 year old father-in-law who has bad knees and hips. He really enjoys it. Easy smooth operation. Very nice product!", 
    "We aare very happy with the recliner. My husband uses it all the time as he has ostero-arthritis, a difficult time getting in and out of chairs.", 
    "I bought it for my young adult son who has cerebral palsy. it is a good alternative to take long breaks from his wheelchair. He can stand and pivot making it easy to transfer him in and out of this electric chair. He also has a feeding tube because this chair reclines He can be feed in it. The material is easy to clean.", 
    "I am very pleased with my new chair. It is very comfortable to sit ind stand up. Not so great for full recline. I am learning that lift chairs each need to be tried as depending upon size they each fit differently. Very easy to assemble", 
    "Chair arrived today for my Daddy. It is smaller than it appears on the screen; however, it does help him get up from a seated position by himself.", 
    "My sister needed a chair. This is a great price! She is short and overweight, so, it's a bit tight. It works great, she's comfortable and you won't find better value.", 
    "Perfect for my husband who can't get up from a couch due to mobility issues. The only drawback is the back has to recline if you want the footrest extended, which means you can't sit upright if you want to prop up your legs. Other than this, it's worth every penny.", 
    "Bought this for my Dad, he loves it!!!", 
    "The chair has very dangerous casters on it. It will roll out from under you as you attempt to sit. I removed them and put felt sticky pads on the rear. Plastic glides are on the front. Very good chair for a small person otherwise.", 
    "Chair arrived as scheduled. It is so amazing I named it Boris!! The \"leather\" is soft and the chair is cushy and comfortable. It does not recline to a prone position like I had hoped but it reclines just perfectly to prop up the head. The chair is soft padded not stiff and firm so the body gently sinks into it. I am disabled and I found the lift feature perfect! But not before I fell asleep in the chair first! I am very happy with this purchase. I give it 5 stars and highly recommend it!", 
    "Great chair and certainly a help in getting my ill husband on his feet. He is too heavy for me to lift or help up.", 
    "Very good quality chair! I would order it for myself someday! My husband is the one with the knee replacement! He loves a lift chair!", 
    "I am very happy with this chair, I need help getting up from a sitting position in most chairs and this one does help. The material is very nice and the chair at the different positions is comfortable.", 
    "Very comfortable coupled with total ease of movement. The wheels are a plus. Super easy to place in operation.Highly recommend to anyone with a physical profile requiring positive movement forward when exiting.Outstanding price. Recommend to all.", 
    "Leg raising mechanism sticks so leg rest does not retract when chair is sitting up.", 
    "This is a beautiful chair that is very functional as well. I purchased it for my elderly mother, who now ignores her bed and sleeps in the chair instead.", 
    "Good quality - purchased for my brother who was going to have both knees replaced. He said it was a lifesaver - higher so that it doesn't hurt knees when using without lift. Lift works perfectly. Would buy again", 
    "exceeded expectations. \"assembly\" involved only slipping back into chair base.", 
    "*****Very comfortable. Love it.", 
    "I'm having rotator cuff surgery & this power chair will help to make me comfortable during my rehab time.", 
    "I no longer need to ask for help to get up from y chair, amazingly comfortable and helps me stand up at a touch of a button.", 
    "Very comfortable. Nice & Plush. Easy to assemble", 
    "great lift chair... not for over 250 lb person!!!my mom loves the chair..", 
    "A price to fit the wallet and comfortable more than expected for the price.", 
    "Excellent purchase without the high price tag and salesperson hagle from the stores.", 
    "It's a decent chair for the money. I needed a wall hugger because of my space and there aren't many available. It is pretty light weight, but my 250 lb. husband does ok with it. The only thing I have against it , is that it does not have a battery backup. So if the power goes out, you could be in trouble.", 
    "This chair is an excellent quality for the price and the delivery was precisely on schedule! We are very happy with the quality of this Power Recline chair and the ease of ordering it from overstock.com! Thank you.", 
    "After 3 weeks a cog in the motor broke. They replaced the chair.", 
    "Power lift does the job. Comfortable and fits my average build. Good value. Recommend it to those who need the power lift.",
