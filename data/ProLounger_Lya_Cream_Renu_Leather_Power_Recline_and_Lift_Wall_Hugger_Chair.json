    "Extreme comfort and ease of use of disabled, as well as able bodies. Was purchased for an uncle who was dealing with a terminal illness that left it almost impossible for his attendant to lift him in and out of his ordinary \"favorite\" loungers. Stand Assist setting made it possible to get him in and out of the chair without breaking the back of the attendant and aggravating the patient. Rest of family now using it, all ages take advantage of the comfort levels and ability to lay back and lounge, read, watch TV, or just talk with friends. Thick cushiony upholstery very soft.", 
    "I bought this chair for my 87 yr old mother with Arthritis, and cannot get up from sitting This chair is the BEST , because it looks great in the room and does the job! I hope it lasts for years, because she is in it most of every day!", 
    "I am an amputee of the right leg. These new push back chairs are not for me. I LOVE MY POWER CHAIR! I cannot lie flat so I am in this chair most of the time. It is comfortable and easy to assemble and easy to use. I wish the foot stool would go up more than it does. I get swelling in my left leg and it has to be elevated. I need a pillow under my lleg. Arrived quickly and in greaat condition. Was sitting in it in10 mins from the arrival. Anyone with weak legs or none(LIKE ME) needs this chair. I miss the old ones with the handle on the side. But life will go on. This chair looks nice and price was fair.", 
    "This is a very comfortable chair. It is quiet and it moves very easily. The only negative comment is this: NO INSTRUCTIONS! Since we had to attach the back and it has a control, it would be nice to have had some instructions. Other than that, we are very happy with the chair.", 
    "I bought this chair for my elderly mother she loves it and uses it everyday ! I have only had it for 5 weeks so far so good ! The chair is heavy over 150lbs I am not sure how it would move on a rug or from floor to floor.", 
    "Beautiful chair that is compact enough to fit in my small living room. The tilt and lift functions work smoothly and silently. The color (cream) is perfect. Had some issues with assembly, the \"prongs\" that the back connects to were canted outward and I was not strong enough to force them to the middle. I had to bring in my strong son-in-law to make it work. Unfortunately, scratches are already showing up on the bonded leather from my cat's claws. Altogether, I am pleased with the purchase and plan to get a lot of use out of it while recovering from my two upcoming knee replacement surgeries.", 
    "I have been looking for a lift chair for my husband for a while. These are very expensive, averaging from $800-1200!! When I went to local furniture stores, the prices were shocking. Plus, I would have to pay to get it to my house, probably $50-100.So, I checked Overstock. I admit that I haven't bought from overstock in many years. Why oh why have I neglected this wonderful site?I saw this chair featured for $377. Wow, that got my attention. I checked all of the other reviews and they looked very good. Then I compared this cream colored chair with the same items by the manufacturer that were brown or black. Same chair, different, lower price. I think the black/brown chairs were about $577 or so. The only reason I can think is that the light color is not what consumers wanted. Well, I went with the cream colored chair. Plus, it was delivered for FREE. Wonderful savings for me. I did think about it for a few days, then when I placed the order I came back to Overstock to see that it was sold out!! I think I may have gotten the last one. Hopefully they will be able to restock this chair for you. All in all, a wonderful purchase, my DH is happy, it blends in with our room, a good, soft \"pleather\" material, easy to manipulate. And Very comfortable. It was delivered to my driveway, and I had a young person help me getting it into the house. It was heavy, and we slid it up into the house. Assembly was easy. Just put the top onto the bottom. Great.The chair looks like it is narrow and would not accommodate a large person. My DH is 245 lbs. When a person sits down, the sides snuggle up to your hips and give a special kind of comfort. He is very happy with the chair. Full recline, lift to almost standing, outstanding value. I couldn't be happier.", 
    "IT'S THE ONLY CHAIR THAT LETS ME GET OUT OF IT.", 
    "\"Really a great price on these chairs, Good workmanship as well. great color easy to clean with a soft damp color. They are a breeze to get up with thanks to lift section, they recline well. They have a nice pocket on the side to store the controls in they were easy to put together. I just followed the directions. Get one if you can they are great.\"", 
    "Chair seat a little small. Comes in one package, easy to assemble. Two wheels were bent on mine but took wheels off any ways so was not a issue for me. If you don't have carpet you will want to do this also or it will slide across floor when you recline.", 
    "This has been a great chair. The quality, look and comfort are outstanding. I did have a problem with it when someone over 300lbs used it, otherwise it has been great.", 
    "The chair is great but the service is awesome. We received the first chair and it was making a mechanical sound that made me worry there would be a problem. I called and they immediately sent out a new chair! The new chair works perfect and my husband is extremely proud that it helps him get up and out of the chair.", 
    "It's between a ok and average. Nothing to really brag about. Could be a little stronger. Doesn't recline all the way back. Remote is pretty sensitive and can be a pain. I expected a better.", 
    "Love these chairs. I ordered 2 at that price. First of all they came well packaged and easy to put together. They are comfortable, work quietly.I like that they are wall huggers. The lift works well too. I couldn't be happier!", 
    "Chair arrived, good looking and great seat. We Like It, However! Why don't you just call it LEATHER LIKE, or VINYL. also - -It has a 3 inch tear in left side panel, And the Box had whole where looks like a fork lift tongue went through it. \ufffcI took pictures of it but can not attach to your e-mail...", 
    "I purchased this chair for my mom who needs assistance getting up from a chairs. She absolutely loves it. The leather is soft and easy to clean. It lifts her far enough forward so her feet are placed directly on the floor. It reclines far enough so she can sleep on it as well. Extremely comfortable. Excellent product.", 
    "Although the box was ripped in several places, the chair was undamaged and, as other reviewers have said, very easy to set up and enjoy. Will be having shoulder surgery and think I will be able to get in and out with ease and even sleep, if necessary, in this chair.", 
    "This is the best recliner I have ever sat in!!! Would highly recommend this!", 
    "Was looking for an assist chair my eldest family member. It was very easy to assemble, the price was great compared to any other chairs in a \"leather\" style, and its control functions are easy to operate. Hopefully it will continue operate for years to come.", 
    "Other than going back further in a sleeping position it's wonderful. Sturdy and not too oversized. Faux leather is so plush and looks like an expensive leather. I love it.", 
    "I've had this chair for over a year now and it seems fine. It is comfortable for me. I don't really need the lift part of it. I purchased it initially for a visiting friend. The lift worked just fine for her. I do, however use the electric mechanism for reclining and it's just fine. It's called \"cream\" and it is a very light cream. For the price, which at the time was very good, it is a decent chair. The faux leather looks very realistic. I, personally, don't love the color, but I had to accept it at the time. But that's on me. It looks just like the picture. I put a taupe color chair protector on it, and it looks very nice, blending better with my neutral furniture. Not disappointed.", 
    "I really shopped around to different store outlets for an affordable leather recliner for my husband. Fortunately, Overstock was my first stop. I did a lot of comparisons, in terms of price, quality and functionality. Overstock provided a very thorough and helpful description. The color of the chair is truly a cream color, the leather looks great, and the ease of assembly was incredible, as it only took my husband twenty minutes to assemble both chairs. I purchased two chairs and my husband and I love them. The chairs have wheels, which we find extremely helpful because we have carpet that partially covers our hardwood floors. Do yourself a favor and purchase this chair ASAP. Oh, by the way we live in an apartment and I was initially hesitant about purchasing a lift recliner chair because our doorways are only 32 inches wide and 72\" high. All we did was remove the two pieces from the box and it was a breeze to get the two pieces inside our apartment door. Thanks Overstock!", 
    "Grandma is 87 and relatively healthy. She came back from a trip to Alaska and had used a lift assist chair. She said she wanted one, so we looked it up. The first one was crushed in shipping, but a second was promptly shipped out. Eas to put together. Reasonably comfortable and easy to use. Grandma likes it a lot, and she doesn't like a whole lot of anything, and is happy to tell you about it!", 
    "Bought this for my 94 yr old mom. Very stylish and petite. The motor is extremely quiet. Not super high quality fabric but for the price it's great.", 
    "I purchased the reclyner for my surgery, it feel great but I wishe that it would reclined as low as it showed in the picture. But overall, great for the price!!!!!", 
    "Bought it for my mom who is turning ninety, and she can't stop talking about how comfortable it is! Perfect for Simone who needed a boost ..lol one of the best purchases I have made on overstock and great price for the quality of product received :)", 
    "Love this chair. Easy to power and get out of chair. Great delivery time.", 
    "I really like the chair. Will be so easy to get out of when I have my knee surgery. Great color.", 
    "Bought this for my 90-year-old dad who is very picky on design and comfort. He doesn't like big chunky things . He loved this chair and uses it all the time it was the best investment we ever made . Real leather a German motor what more can I ask for except hoping everything last with no break down . Thrilled.", 
    "Our chair arrived with UPS delivering a large box to our porch and back in his van before we could answer the front door. Our son and grandson came over removed the chair that had died and replaced with the newly delivered assembling it with ease. It is remarkably comfortable. We are very pleased.", 
    "I was very impressed with product and purchase !!! 1st buyer....will be back....chair is beautiful, works as listed, easy to assemble, and delivery was a breeze !!! I am very picky about furniture and this piece is impeccable !!", 
    "Very attractive - works great.", 
    "I bought this chair for my husband who was having difficulty sitting up - it worked perfectly! I love the chair as well - it is attractive, reclines beautifully, was a superb buy and is very comfortable! And, the Customer Service that I received from Overstock was 100% Outstanding!", 
    "Nice looking, easy to put together, very quiet motor. A bit too deep for comfort", 
    "Got this because I was having a tummy tuck and arm lift. I'm very happy with it. Made life a lot easier the first days and it looks nice!", 
    "Comfortable and easy to use.", 
    "My chair arrived yesterday, and I couldn't be happier. Unpacking and assembly was very easy, and the wheels on the chair made it easy to move to the place I wanted to position it in my living room. This is an excellent piece for anyone with hip injuries such as myself from delivery to use!", 
    "Was looking for something affordable to aid my elderly parents in getting in and out of chairs safely. My parents are happy with them.", 
    "It was exactly what we needed for mom. Perfect size and very comfortable", 
    "Purchased for my mother, 85 years old. Easy to operate & looks great. Faux leather is soft & looks genuine. It does run small. My mother is 5'2\", 102 lbs. & it is a good size for her. Would not recommend for a large person. If you're small it's great!", 
    "WELL I HAVE NOT PUT IT TOGETHER YET, IT CAME WITH FLEAS,SO I NOW HAVE TO GET MY HOUSE RID OF THEM BEFORE I PUT THEM TOGETHER,YES I BOUGHT TWO. THE BOX IS DAMAGED AND LOOKED AS IF IT WAS STORED A WHILE SO I ASSUME SOME FURRY VARMENT GOT INSIDE.", 
    "Love it! Great price and its so comfortable", 
    "Purchased this for a 96 year old who was unable to get out of her regular chair/lounger with painful legs. Now I am sorry I did not get one for myself! It is beautiful, very soft. My mom LOVES it. Easy setup, just insert back into base. When she first tried the chair, tears came to her eyes. For the first time in months she was able to get out of her chair by herself. Motor is very quiet. Very happy with this purchase.", 
    "I gave it 3 stars because for someone like me who has had 3 back surgeries, it is not that comfortable a chair. The lift part of it is great, the support and padding for the lumbar and neck areas are not very good & supportive but again for the money I guess I should not expect much. I would not recommend this chair for anyone that needs good support and comfort after back surgery", 
    "Best recliner ever. Extremely satisfied. This chair is a great help for my grandmother who has a heart condition and can operate all functions remotely. What's more it is so comfortable, everyone tries to use it. And most of all it was a great bargain!", 
    "I was excited with my purchase when it arrived. It is good looking piece of furniture and easy to assemble. One week after purchase however, I noticed the chair clearly leaning towards the right with a clear indentation in the cushion. You get what you pay for.", 
    "I have only had my chair for three days, but it is so great for my needs. I had finally gotten so that it was very painful to stand from my former recliner. This wonderful chair is so right! The color shown in the photo is very accurate. Mine is a true ivory/cream color and it has a smallish profile, so it fits well in my family room. It only needs four inches of space to clear the wall when fully reclined, honestly. It is very comfortable and soft enough without swallowing me up! This was a true treat to myself!", 
    "Love this chair. Bought it for my 91 year old mother who resides in a nursing home. She sits in it all day long. Loves the ability to get in and out by herself. Very comfortable & the price was great!", 
    "Quality and delivery great. Comfortable. Only one thing to keep in mind -- this chair is not good for anyone 6\" or over.", 
    "MAKES IT SO MUCH EASIER FOR HIM TO STAND AND ALLOWS HIM THE TIME NEEDED WITHOUT RUSHING...IT HAS STEADY PACE. EASY TO ASSEMBLE. JUST THE RIGHT SIZE FOR HIS BEDROOM. LOOKS GOOD TOO..", 
    "I love the small scale of this recliner,it is for my 98 yr old mother", 
    "i shop overstock frequently but this chair is one of the best purchases I have yet to make! Great quality, comfortable. Would buy again and again!", 
    "Love this chair. The off white goes with everything. Great buy.", 
    "well I ordered it due to good reviews . Came before time so five stars for that. It has a lift too that is plus for older people but me and my wife we are in 30\"s so it dont matter much . Color is as shown in the picture. It came in a box which was damaged and at one place the faux leather is chipped . The chair is comfortable but there is no lumbar support as some review mentioned. One thing I noticed that you can not adjust the back independent of foot rest so some time there is an awkward position where the leg is fully extended and the back is still at the sitting position. If you keep on going then the back will go backward. I NEED TO WARN YOU PEOPLE THAT ONE TIME I TRIED TO GET SOME THING FROM THE FRONT WHEN CHAIR WAS FULLY RELAXED AND IT ALMOST TOPPLED AND I MIGHT HAVE FALLEN OFF FROM THE CHAIR. So If you are buying it for your older parents please make sure they dont lean forward too much other wise they can get into accident. Also wheels are real tiny and there are no brakes so if you have it on hard wood floor like mine they will leave marks and when u sit on it , it will go backwards and it is annoying . Also the motor is calm but is making some weird novice now and then of the spring pooping out and I think it might be ok . I hope the motor lasts as there is no other way to use this recliner if motor goes away . It does not look very high end so you can not put it in formal living room . I think for the money it is good if it lasts 3-4 years . Next time I am going to invest in some thing that is build sturdy and will last longer like lazy boys . I will update review in 6 months to see how it is doing . till then thanks for reading.", 
    "Purchased this chair for 89 year old aunt. This chair is just what she needed. It was easy to put together. Just slide the back into the slot and plug it in. No one said how many pieces it would come in. Was relieved as to how easy it was. She loves it and it was very easy for her to operate.", 
    "This chair exceeded my expectations. It really is a nice quality chair. However, I bought this for my mom who is handicapped and she refuses to sit in it because she says she slips down. I suspect it is not the chair but my mother's persnickety ways. My sister LOVES it! It looks lovely in the living room, right next to the old raggedy one Mom refuses to throw away.", 
    "It is an Ok Chair. You need to be very careful with it. It is balanced very badly. If you try to scoot your self up in it when it is in the recline position it will tip up and drop the person in it to the floor. I took off the wheels, didn\u2019t help. I ended up screwing the chair into the floor with 6 in screws to keep it from tipping forward.", 
    "This is an awesome chair love", 
    "Easily moved having four wheels, I ordered two and was not really disappointed they are very nice, sturdy built .comfortable ,smooth quiet motors I'm 5 ft tall so it was a little hard getting into until I put floor protectors on the back wheels which kept the chair from moving but my husband being 5 '9'' had no trouble getting in his at all and yes they will lift 300 lbs well worth the money so far..", 
    "So easy to put together!! Comfy, stylish! Works as expected. A little narrower than I thought, wouldnt work for a \"big\" person. Just right for us!!", 
    "This chair is well built and supports your entire body. Recent reconstructed lower back surgery. Full recovery is 9 months. This bought two for these and one for my brother.", 
    "100% a very good product it was easy to put together. My hips and back pain is better since I receive the chair. My swelling in my legs are decrease because I can recline and elevate them. Thanks for making it affordable.", 
    "My husband has bone cancer and has limited mobility at this time. This chair is an answered prayer. He can get in and out and adjust it to meet his needs. Don't know what we did without it.", 
    "I had hip replacement and bought this power recliner for assistance. It has been the perfect chair to keep my hip from possible dislocation. Ordered one for my husband so we had matching chairs. He loves the great support, as well, even though he doesn't need the assistance. Bought it on sale too.....it was a great buy!", 
    "Chair has a bad smell causing head ach and nausea Returning items for refund.", 
    "Mu husband, you never likes to get rid of any furniture, was very reluctant to give up his 40-yr-old chair. After his recent hospitalization, I asserted myself and swapped it for this recliner/lift chair...which he now loves! It's his throne. The chair does not take up a lot of space, but is very roomy and comfortable. The only (very minor) complaint my husband has is that there is not enough of a ridge in the foot/leg rest for him to dig in his heels.It arrived very quickly and in good condition. If you have difficulty moving or lifting heavy things, be sure to get some help getting it out of the box and assembling it. Assembly is very easy--just 2 pieces.", 
    "Gorgeous and so comfortable.", 
    "The chair arrived ahead of time, so it was delivered in more than timely fashion. It was ordered for my 96 yr old aunt, and seems to be working well. The only negative is that it is so big for her small frame that she can't touch the ground, and feels swallowed up. She hasn't been using it because I don't think she can coordinate the buttons and claims that it \"throws her out\". I think she just needs some more practice. She was ordered to keep her legs elevated by doctor, so now she's been using it. I think it's a beauitful piece of furniture, and love the cream color. Time will tell...but, I think it will be fine for her. (I did have to put a non-slip rug on it so she didn't slide on the leather, but that's no fault of the chair).", 
    "Nice but I don't know if it's real leather", 
    "Assists patients needing to get up to ambulate very well", 
    "The only problem is if reclined it can tip forward", 
    "Got this for my mom after her spinal fusion surgery. It came in 2 days and was perfect - easy to setup, terrific material and incredibly comfortable.", 
    "We ordered the chair and after a few days asked for it to be returned and then send another one. There was a mil dew smell right out of the box. Eyes watering and throat burning and this was with both chairs. I am trying home remedies to stop the odor and then will call in a professional to get rid of the odor. My wife loves the chair and it is perfect in all ways but the above.", 
    "Helps my wife with her battle with cancer.", 
    "This is a great chair...not too big. Feels very nice.", 
    "This chair is not too big and not too little but is JUST RIGHT!!! The right size for me, the right size for the corner of the room it is in, and the right color. It is SOOOO comfortable! Still getting used to the remote but coming along. Love this chair!!", 
    "Works fine but wheels make it tricky for unsteady elderly", 
    "I bought this for someone in a nursing home and she loves it. It's working quite well for her.", 
    "Best chair I have ever had. Like it was made for me. Very comfortable! Looks great with my other furniture.", 
    "Works every well, helping my husband up! Nice color that goes with everything!", 
    "We ordered this for it's size as we were putting it in our sunroom which is small. The chair is small. Seemed fine for a few days then developed loud noises when in operation. ??? No idea what is with it, but is distracting to say the least. My husband has had 2 strokes and needed the lift ability. If I were to do it over, think I would buy one locally to have service on it.", 
    "Really comfortable and ease of use, nice looking as well.", 
    "This is a great piece of furniture and my Mom actually loves it!", 
    "Damaged on shipping or rating would be 5 stars so quiet and smooth operating very comfortable k jist what I needed love the leather like material", 
    "Keeps throwing you of chair. Lifts too high and am afraid I'll break my hip. Do not use anymore", 
    "Excellent buy. Just as pictured. Very happy with it. Thanks", 
    "Purchased this chair for my mom. She enjoys the convenience getting up & out of the chair. It is very comfortable & the wall hugging is nice for small, tight spaces. I was just a little disappointed in the material it was made of. I knew it was not real leather. It has a cheap feel to it.", 
    "My motherinlaw is very happy with this chair. she is tiny, but it's not too big for her, we worried that it might be. it takes up no more room than her old, petite recliner did, but is plenty roomy for my husband. it reclines well and the remote is simple and effective. The sale price was 1/2 what we found locally. The delivery was free and easy! I highly recommend this chair!", 
    "Grandma loves her lift chair. She can manage it easily.", 
    "Great chair, very comfortable and easy to use, also very quiet.", 
    "Love the chairs. We got two. One had a faulty controller and got stuck in up position. Called Handy Living and sent another. Took a little longer than told but worked out fine", 
    "Bought 2 of these for my senior parents. They work great and are attractive chairs. Also very comfortable. Highly recommend them!", 
    "this is a must have for someone who needs a lift chair, it doesn't look like a typical lift chair, it fits in with every day furniture, and so very comfortable. I received it very quickly, and it is just great", 
    "I love this recliner! It is of good quality and very comfy. I take a short nap in it everyday, sometimes more than one :-) I liked it so much I got another one just like it for my living room. They both came to my door on time and in perfect condition. Delivery men were very nice. Chair is easy to put together. Love it!", 
    "Just what the doctor ordered", 
    "Ordered for our 93 year old cousin. She loves it and the price beat that of specialized rehab stores.", 
    "easy & affordable version of these chairs. works as well as the expensive chair he has at home.", 
    "Comfortable. Space between back and seat doesn't come together. Can see a two to three inch space in each corner area between seat and back. Right arm cushion not stuffed to capacity, causing material to gather up at end..", 
    "This chair was delivered promptly and was even better than I expected.", 
    "Not the greatest feel of leather but excellent value for the money very happy", 
    "Great chair for recovery from abdominal surgery and reasonably priced for recovery use", 
    "I purchased this chair for my 93 year old Grandma who was in denial she needed a power lift and recliner chair. I am very happy I made the purchase. It's only been about 2 months, but so far everything is still working fine. Grandma is only 4'6\" (now lol), so this chair is just a wee bit big for her, but it is by far still a chair built for smaller people. The remote control recliner and lift feature is something every senior should have. Great purchase.", 
    "Love this chair, it is exactly like the description and works well.", 
    "Well made and perfect for my sister in law who needs assistance getting up from a chair.", 
    "My husband has Parkinson's and has problems getting in and out of chairs, this chair is perfect! He loves it and it looks very nice as well. You can't beat the price.", 
    "Chair arrived quickly and in good condition. It works as advertised, and the synthetic leather covering looks good and appears to be of good quality (time will tell). The chair has casters at the rear, which unfortunately do not have latches, so the chair tends to move too easily on hard surface floors (which I have). Also, all of the assembly parts were in a bag fastened to the underside of the chair, but there were no instructions informing me of this! Had to discover this the hard way! Once I recovered to parts, assembly was straightforward. All in all, I consider the chair to be a good value at the discounted price which I paid.", 
    "I loved the first one so. I ordered a second one. My friends with bad knees and hips love it too.?", 
    "i was very nervous about ordering furniture online without seeing the items. i am so happy with them i ordered 2",

    "very comfortable....great price for a lift recliner !", 
    "Just received. Easy to put together. Everything works fine. One of the wheels came broken (no big deal). Fabric good be a little sturdier otherwise very pleased with both the look and value of the chair. Would recommend.", 
    "looked at a chair with the same features as one from a specialty store for $$$. Nice leather and easy to assemble.", 
    "like the chair it is just a little narrow but a nice chair", 
    "I'm very happy with my recliner/powerlifting recliner. I love the size, not too big and bulky. I would recommend to buying.", 
    "He loves his father's day present. It was a great surprise. He says it perfect for dozing of while watching the games.", 
    "This electric recliner is a fabulous bargain ! It was easy to assemble and move as it has 4 wheels,is extremely soft leather material and ultra comfortable.Comparable to chairs at twice the price. highly recommend.", 
    "My elderly mom loves this chair. And I love it because it is super-comfortable-- not that I get to use it much myself (she's always in it!). Really good value and attractive. Good purchase- came fast too.", 
    "My mother in law loves it!", 
    "I liked it so much, I bought another one! It's comfortable and the motor and mechanism is very quiet.",

    "Best proudict I have ever bought, without trying it. It is very compfortable, and easy to put together", 
    "I ordered this chair for my 79 year old ailing wife. She had a recliner but it would bump the wall when she reclined. I bought her this incliner and it does everything for her, including lifting her out of the chair. I had to do it all before, now the chair does it all. She loves the chair and will not let anyone else sit in it, including me. After she retires for the evening I sit in her chair for several minutes, it's like sitting on a cloud.", 
    "Great. Very good investment.", 
    "Not really a good leather, but it works well and nice looking otherwise.", 
    "Great chair for a senior! Nice leather and does what is described .Price is exceptional for a chair of this quality.", 
    "Purchased for my 94 yr old father. Great quality. It's not so large that it takes up a great deal of space and the neutral color fits with most any decor. So pleased with this, that we are purchasing a second one.", 
    "Mom has problems getting out of regular recliners. The remote control helps her to lie back or sit up. She gets in and out with ease, after she recuperates from breaking her hip", 
    "I got this for my mother. She is a small woman. It fit her well and I am very happy.", 
    "Great chair. Easy use wish. Could have been delivered to my parlor by movers", 
    "my mother has severe arthritis so standing from a chair is difficult. a year ago she purchased a fully reclining, lift chair for her bedroom. it was so comfortable that she wanted a second chair for the living room. this chair was 1/2 the price, arrived in 1/16 time, and perfectly matched the other chair in color and function. simple controls, just enough cushion to support her back without feeling \"poofy\", and long enough when the leg rest is elevated that her feet don't hand off the end. (she's 5' 6\") the leather upholstery makes it easy to adjust her position with little effort. a plus since do to the arthritis her strength is sapped. she couldn't be happier! super value for a great product! my husband and i bought this online because it matched my mom's criteria for another chair without breaking the bank. however, we were concerned that the lower price would result in an inferior product. we are all very satisfied with the quality and speedy delivery (less than 5 business days vs. 6 weeks) of this chair.", 
    "Great product, very quiet mechanism", 
    "Direct shipped this to the assisted living facility to replace the recliner from which he could no longer stand. When the facility called to let me know the chair had arrived, I went with my tools to assemble it only to find my Dad already happily using it. Quality and functionality are all very good, though I cannot yet comment on durability. At half the price of retail stores, everyone (including the facility staff) ask where I got the chair.", 
    "Purchased this for my elderly mother. First time using overstock and it was a great choice. Pricing was better than other online sites, delivery was quick, and the chair exceeds expectations. This chair feels like luxury and oh so comfortable! The fabric is soft like glove leather, and will be easy to clean. It was very simple to assemble, the back just slides into brackets then snaps in place. No tools required. The seat, back and arms are well padded and seat is nicely cushioned for good support. I especially liked the lumbar support! This chair is best for 'vertically challenged' adults. The lumbar, headrest and foot rest support hit mom's 5'2\" frame perfectly. I am 5'8\", for me the leg rest is a bit short and the head support does not hit the correct area. Anyone taller might not be a comfortable sitting for any length of time.", 
    "Bought this as a gift for my husband and he loves it. It is beautiful and soft. I sit in it whenever he is not around.", 
    "Got My Recline Friday, I'm so excited!! Love this Chair, I bought it for When my mom comes to visit because she sleeps on one at home and I wanted her to be just as comfortable here. It looks awesome in my living room and I love the color and fabric!!", 
    "Hard to get the back on the chair. Instructions were not very helpful. I love the chair. I never noticed that it was on wheels when I ordered it.", 
    "Well I ordered this chair for my 82 year old grandmother. She has had the chair for about a week now and by the way deliver was smooth. She just called me and she was just thanking me for her chair she loves this chair. She said it fits her just right and its so soft and comfortable she does not even sleep in her bed anymore she just falls asleep in her chair. I'm so very pleased with this purchase knowing she is happy with the chair makes my heart smile considering I have not seen the chair myself because she lives in NC and I live in FL......", 
    "Excellent value for money. Works just fine with a 270 lb. man.", 
    "Had lots of questions before buying. The customer service gentleman was amazing. He answered every silly question I threw at him and had a great sense of humor. Actually took the time to speak to his supervisor. Bough the chair and it was delivered on time. Took 5 minutes to put it together. Then I got to sit in it. Aaahhhh. Wonderful.", 
    "I was very surprise by the quality of this furniture and my husband by his comfort.A very good deal.Lina", 
    "The lift chair is great. I had trouble getting it, Finally got a great lady to help. She had the chair over nighted. Thank you Ronda for your help.", 
    "This chair is just what I needed. It works great and I love it Great price also.", 
    "Very Nice Recliner and nice sturdy build that offers the powered Lift and Recline options that are not in most Recliners.", 
    "The price was amazing! The quality is TOP NOTCH! The motor is quite. The PERFECT gift for my disabled husband!!", 
    "Easy assembly, comfortable with good back support. Lays down almost flat. I would highly recommend this chair to anyone who wants a comfortable chair whether they need the lift or not.", 
    "This chair has a nice contemporary look and the motor that reclines or lifts the chair works great. I am pleased with this purchase and would gladly buy another one.", 
    "Arrived on time, great price, comfortable, attractive chair.", 
    "I have a hard time standing up from a chair so this is great for me. Wouldn't get rid of it", 
    "Very nice product and does not look clinical in any way.Works very well and if you have a family member that might need a little help getting out of the chair, and needs to be independent, this ones for you.", 
    "Put in two different rooms of our home. Easy set up and very comfortable. Very easy to use.", 
    "Bought this chair for my 85 year old mother who has severe arthritis in her knees. She loves it and so does anyone else who sits in it!", 
    "This was my first purchase from Overstock, so was hopeful it would be a good one. I am pleased with my purchase. It was easy to put the back on the chai. Hooked it up and it worked beautifully. Good purchase.", 
    "Took 10 minutes to unpack and setup.. EXTREMELY QUIET MOTOR.WORKS GREAT.", 
    "I searched long and hard for a good recliner.. that search came to an end when I purchased this one. It is like a cloud sitting down and reclining on this !!", 
    "I bought this for the color and price,u can't find a lift chair at this price.I haven't been able to use the power part because it didn't come with the power cord.I callled and they r supposed to be sending me one.It sits nice and ooks like it cost a lot more than it did.", 
    "The chair is a lot more attractive than I expected and the perfect size for 5'7\" elderly owner. Her feet hang a bit off the end when reclining but she says is very comfortable. She looks like she has a throne, not like she's being swallowed by an overstuffed monster. Mechanisms are quiet and smooth. Sometime she is confused about which button to push to either recline or stand-up but because you have to continually press button to do either, any mistake in direction is easily corrected. The chair was very easy to put together and as a wall-hugger, needs much less space. The only thing is that it is light and can move, so we braced its feet so it wouldn't move backward toward the wall and make it difficult to recline. Good bargain-- the staff at assisted living was astonished to hear the price!"
