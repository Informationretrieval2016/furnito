    "I recently purchased this ottoman and am very pleased with its appearance. The tufted fabric adds a nice touch. I was really easy to assemble .. the legs are already attached by a hinge and only require some screws. Very pleased with the purchase.", 
    "We recently bought a bedroom set with very similar lines & color of wood. I felt this would go nicely at the foot of our bed to put our comforter on at night, to sit on when putting on shoes, etc. It worked out perfectly & I am very happy with the piece, as well as the price. I would say it's very true to colors I viewed on my laptop. The tufted top is really nice too.",

    "I don't love it, but it's easy to assemble and there were no suprises in appearance or quality. I wanted it at the foot of my bed but it's bigger than I thought and a bit too bulky."
