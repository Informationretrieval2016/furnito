    "cute and a really good value for the money", 
    "I didn't have many expectations for this product at this price, so I wasn't disappointed. It is just very average in every respect. There were a lot of screws to get it together, and the pieces didn't exactly fit all-that well, but it is together and in use for the purpose for which it was intended. The bottom shelf was too low to the ground, so I left it off.", 
    "I liked the item but it is smaller than you might think. The package I received hay the screws loose in the box and there were three screws missing. A bit of a hassle as I had to go out and buy screws but overstock did apologize and gave me a partial credit. Their customer service was very helpful and easy to work with. I would recommend this item."
