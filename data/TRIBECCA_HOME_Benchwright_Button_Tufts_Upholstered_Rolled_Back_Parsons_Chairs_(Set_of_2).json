    "I waited a long time for these chairs to come back up on Overstock and when they did I jumped on them right away. I needed ten chairs and they are a nice contrast to my rustic reclaimed barn wood table. The fabric is more beige than ivory, which is good as I have little ones. I also sprayed them with Scotchguard just in case which created no problems with the fabric. My only complaint is that they were hard to assemble-- meaning the screw holes did not match up exactly and as a result some of the chairs are a little wobbly. I fixed this with fabric \"feet\" stuck to the bottom of problematic legs. Still, I shouldn't have had to do this. Since I assembled ten of them and encountered the same problems with the first as I did the last, I'm sure it wasn't me but the product itself. Still, I love the chairs and they look great; I would recommend them (but know what you're up against with assembly).", 
    "I spent forever hunting for the perfect chairs to go with my new farmhouse dining table, and I'm happy to say these are indeed the perfect ones!!! They are so graceful and gorgeous to look at, very sturdy, and super comfy, and at a great price too! The padding is plush and firm, and the leather is pretty and easy to wipe clean, so I think they'll last a long time. We use these at every single meal, and they can definitely handle heavy use. These don't have to be just pretty -- they're functional too. They came quicker than predicted, which was a nice surprise, and they were well packaged and came out of the boxes in good shape with protective wrap and all hardware needed. Building them was not a piece of cake, I won't lie -- I bought six, but I actually had to have my handymen help me with the last two of them because I had such a hard time getting the holes to line up right. Tip: when attaching the seat of the chair to the back, don't do both screws on a single side and then the other side. Instead, alternate sides as you screw, and screw loosely at first and then go back and tighten. It's tricky, but it's worth it. Be sure to really tighten everything as hard as you can so the chair doesn't wobble. And save the Allen wrench so you can occasionally tighten them again if they loosen with use. Buy these chairs! You won't regret it!!!", 
    "I always worry about beige colors because there are sooo many shades; rest assured this is a perfect linen blend, not too dark not too light. This chair is comparable to *********** ******* at a much better price. Color of fabric is nearly identical to *********** ******** belgian linen in sand. They are comfortable and look plush. Perfectly complement our custom made English walnut dining table. Wish I could post a pic. Color is true to pic you see online but, looks even better in person! Hope this helps", 
    "The good - No flaws in the bonded leather or leg finishes. Assembly went very quickly. All the holes lined up with all the hardware on mine, yay! Hardware included lock washers, so they shouldn't loosen as easily as other chairs we've assembled. Bolts seem very strong & sturdy, unlike other flimsy chair screws that I've gotten that seemed to be made out of tinfoil.The bad - I expected the chair backs to be more cushy, they are very stiffly padded. Only time will tell how the bonded leather holds up, but they're for my very young grandkids and should be easy to clean!!", 
    "I LOVE these chairs so much that I am going to buy two more. They run out very quickly! Overstock shipped them to me very quickly within the week. Received them nicely packed. Assembly was a breeze...", 
    "Received this with a broken part, which Overstock replaced in a little over a week. Easy to assemble. Key is to screw in each of the screws a little bit at a time, so the parts remain lined up. Very comfortable to sit on. Not sure how well it will hold up to everyday use with children or teenagers.", 
    "Really like these chairs. I bought 6 for my dining room and they look much more expensive than I paid. They were also very easy to assemble.", 
    "I am so happy that I went ahead and ordered these chairs. I ordered 3 sets for my dining room.and was a little nervous with not being able to see/feel them first. The style/size is just what I was looking for and the color was spot on. I went with the light grey color and it is perfect. The textured upholstery really gives a great look. The only downfall was putting them together. It took my husband a couple hours to complete them all and we were missing a few pieces. But we are overall happy!", 
    "I am happy with this purchase from beginning to end! I've had 6 of them for about 3 weeks and they arrived within 3-4 days of ordering. Unlike some customer's reviews, I had NO problem assembling the chairs. I'm a middle-aged,105 lb.woman. I read through the three steps (yes, only 3), before starting, laid out all hardware, and then proceeded. Tips: line up all the the holes on the legs and back visually and then pop in the screws. I wonder if other people had problems with lining up the holes because of humid environments. I live in Chicago area where it is cold and I assembled them right out of the box so no chance of the wood swelling (if it even does). After attaching the legs I placed the chair seat on my sofa (seat side down) and attached the back. That way the seat rested on the sofa so I didn't have to hold it and my hands were both free to pop the screws in. DO NOT tighten each screw fully with the tool until all have been inserted and loosely fastened first. I went around and tightened all screws individually about three times until all were clamped tightly and there was no \"play\" or creaking on any part (legs, or back). Each chair took approx. 30-40 min. Fingers did get a little sore towards the last chairs so I put on rubber gloves for extra gripping power!The fabric, light beige in my case, is very nice. it's not too thin and looks higher end. All tufts were in the right location, none offset and the assembly of the fabric to the chair frame was well done. The chair itself is sturdy, padding is plentiful, and the seating is firm, but not uncomfortably so. It may give a little over time but If not, I'll be happy with that and the chair will retain its nicely curved cushion lines.I took another reviewer's advice and Scotchguarded the entire chair as I have two kids and this is our primary seating. The fabric took the Scotchguarding with no discoloration and I had the opportunity to test it two nights ago on a teeny spot of spaghetti sauce with a damp towel. It lifted right off.Since I've had them about a month it's probably time to check the screws and make sure they are still tight.I am extremely happy with the chairs and think they were a great price and quality compared to other similar ones at retail stores in my area.If you are seriously considering them, go for it...I don't think they'll dissappoint!", 
    "Beautiful chairs, the color is as pictured, the quality is better than I expected. My husband assembled them easily and they don't wobble (like many reviewers had mentioned). Perfect for our new kitchen table!", 
    "These chairs are absolutely gorgeous! I get ALOT of compliments on the chairs. I will say that I had to \"stalk\" the website to wait for them to get re-stocked. The beige color tends to sell out very quickly. I had a very good customer service experience when returning the light grey color to exchange for the beige color. My biggest complaint is that this item does not allow you to be notified when the item is re-stocked which is why I had to check the website several times a day waiting for it to get re-stocked. In this day and age of technology, there should be a better way. The chairs were easy to put together as well, but my husband did say that he was fortunate that he had all the proper tools. I will also comment that these chairs are on the narrow side. My dining room is mostly used for \"looks\" so it works absolutely perfectly for me as my table is not over-crowded with chairs since they are narrow.", 
    "These chairs are very comfortable and very good quality. They went perfect with our restoration hardware Trestle dining room table. These chairs are very hard to find in stock, but totally worth it. Easy assembly.", 
    "Ordered the (light) gray linen and they are great - especially love the distressed finish on the legs which matches perfectly with my farm table! Easy to assemble as well. Actually decided to order another set of two. :)", 
    "Look nice for the price. A bit hard to sit on but not bad.", 
    "So one of the chairs we purchased had a completely broken leg when we were removing from the box (that sucked). I was about to throw my hands in the air when assembling, as it seemed that the holes weren't well aligned and the allen wrench was literally almost tearing my hands apart.HOWEVER, I used my own allen wrench from my tool set and found that if you drill in the angled screws about halfway each, THEN the last three in the middle, the angled screws go in much better. You have to just put some strength into it, which I was reluctant to do because I was afraid they would strip.. they won't. You will go back and forth a time or two to completely screw everything in tight, but once you do you should be gravy.Anyway, the color I bought (dark linen gray) is now out of stock so we can't get a replacement at the moment for the broken chair, but love what we have.", 
    "sturdy and comfy. the gray is not solid, but I like this to help hide any stains.", 
    "I bought 2 of the grey chairs. The only complaint I could have is they were a little hard to put together (oil the screws and trim around the screw hole in the chair) chairs look great and are comfortable I would buy them again.", 
    "Very pleased with my chairs. They seem to be well built and are expensive looking.", 
    "Ordered these chairs in grey and accented with patterned chairs on the side. OBSESSED. They look so good! Will definitely recommend and would definitely buy again!", 
    "The legs aren't even so we put felt underneath to even them out but I love the chairs and would buy again.", 
    "Love love love them! They look great with my new dining room table. I hope they hold up well. My husband was irritated putting them together but they look pretty at least!", 
    "Bought these for our dining room and they are very comfortable. Lots of padding. I was originally going to put skirts on them, but they are very pretty without. My husband put them together and assembly seemed pretty easy.", 
    "Very pretty and reasonably priced.", 
    "Love these chairs for my dining room table ends. They were very easy to assemble. So glad I found them. And the color is amazing!!!", 
    "These chairs really bring out my dining room.", 
    "I really like the quality of the fabric good product", 
    "Easy to assemble. Look like in pictures.", 
    "Easy assembly. Solid, comfortable chairs. Exactly what I was looking for.", 
    "The chairs came in a very timely manner. I ordered six in the dark grey linen fabric. I was very pleased. They are well made and very comfortable. I was concerned since I was purchasing them site unseen. You will need to assemble them and I would suggest a person to help, at least on the first chair. After that, you should be able to manage. Super happy!", 
    "I love these chairs. They are sturdy and well made. They look great in my newly remodeled space", 
    "Love the light grey color, looks great with my farmhouse table. Still have yet to put them together, so I'm hoping it's as easy as the other reviews claim!", 
    "I love these chairs. They look great in my dining room. The color was very dark charcoal which is what I wanted and it matched with the screen image. I had one chair with a shorter leg that will have to be replaced. But, I ordered 6 in total and the rest were fine. I think these will last and look good for many years.", 
    "great chair and easy to mount", 
    "Bought these chairs to replace our old dining room chairs. They are very comfortable and look great!", 
    "Love these chairs! Bought 8 for my new large dining table and they are perfect. Easy to assemble, sturdy, comfortable and very stylish. Would definitely recommend1", 
    "We absolutely love these chairs! Mthey are beautiful, sturdy and very comfortable. We replaced our old hard chairs with these and it totally updated the look of our dining room. So why did I give them 4 stars instead of 5? They were a bear to put together! Out of 6 chairs, one went together quickly and easily. The rest took some major hand strength to get the screws in. The reason became apparent after the first chair. The fabric is sometimes not trimmed from the screw holes, so it can block the screw from engaging. That helped. There was actually only one area on each chair that was problematic and that was where the back legs attached to the seat. The backs went together with the seat like a breeze, and the front legs attached easily as well. I recommend a rubber grip to wrap around the Allen wrench to save your hands. But, now that all six chairs are done, we love them enough to assemble them all over, so it's worth a little pain and aggregation. And the price is unbeatable!Buy them, you won't be sorry!", 
    "Absolutely love my chairs. Easy screw on legs that I did on my own. Perfect height and the seat cushion not bad either. Well worth the pricetag", 
    "These chairs are amazing! Look exactly as pictured. Amazing for this price.", 
    "These chairs looks so good! And exactly like the picture online. Putting them together was really easy, we followed instructions and were done putting them together in like 10 min. The cushion is so comfortable and the linen seems durable, definitely recommend them!", 
    "I bought this set of chairs so we would have two extra seats at the dining room table. They are not very high quality, and one was hard to put together as other reviewers have noted. One chair has a slight \"wobble\" since the legs aren't even. But with a foot pad underneath it remedied the problem. The price was great and they work fine for what we needed them for.", 
    "After looking at many chairs all over town we finally ordered these. They're perfect and much more comfortable than those at twice the cost!", 
    "Nice chairs. Kinda frustrating to put together but turned out nice.", 
    "I have purchased 2 sets of chairs(4), and we have been enjoying them for about a month now and they are beautiful with my glass table. The cushions are firm and lots of support on the back (totally what I was looking for!). Assembly was pretty simple except one glitch where one of the boxes I received, all the screws and washers somehow fell out of the bag and rolled all over the box.. the box had a big hole so I was missing a couple ring washers (luckily, my husband had extras on hand). I also scotch guarded the chairs before I let my kids sit on them. I read the previous reviews and made sure to cover the wood legs using the packaging wraps (thanks for the tip!) and worked perfectly. The chairs are very reasonably priced, nicely made, and they look beautiful with my glass table. Thanks Overstock!", 
    "I was hesitant to buy chairs online, but these were just what I was looking for to go with the table I ordered. I did not go wrong. These are not only gorgeous but so comfortable and well constructed.", 
    "The chairs are great just what we wanted.", 
    "Just like picture....great quality for the price!", 
    "Beautiful and exactly what i had hoped for!", 
    "After reading all the great reviews I purchased these for my dining room, they are nice looking chairs but you can tell the chairs were inexpensive. I don't see these chairs lasting for much length of time, they would function well as an accent chair but not as a chair that is used often. I decided to keep them and use them in my bedroom to add some interest to the room", 
    "Great quality, even better price!", 
    "Very happy with how these chairs turned out. Highly recommend.", 
    "Very good quality. Haven't tried putting them together yet. Still letting them air out. They have a funky smell.", 
    "I ordered the 4 of these chairs in beige linen. They are beautiful and sturdy. I haven't had them for very long, but I hope they last awhile. Since they are beige linen, I do recommend using scotch guard for easy cleaning. Great purchase!", 
    "Easy to build, solid construction.", 
    "Love these chairs. They really look a lot more expensive than what I paid. Easily could've paid double or more for the same type chairs at Restoration Hardware. Quick delivery and easy to put together. Couldn't be happier.", 
    "Easy to assemble, comfortable, beautiful. Great purchase!", 
    "After assembling the first one the rest were very easy. They look great.", 
    "Pretty easy to put together, good quality, and also very comfortable!! Highly recommend. The light gray is a great color.", 
    "I cant say enough about the chairs. They look so awesome with my dining table that I wish I could upload the picture to show. But, I couldnt ask for more with the chairs. The price was perfect and so is the look. Im very happy with my purchase!", 
    "Beautiful chairs for the price but not easy to put together, screw holes slightly off. Hard to tighten once you manage to get the screws in.", 
    "The chairs compliments the dining room table I already own. I assembled all 4 chairs myself..", 
    "I waited a long time for the beige linen chairs to come in stock. The wait was well worth it. I love these!!! The reclaimed legs match perfectly with our farmhouse table. I almost settled for a similar version with black legs on ****** but I'm so glad I remained patient and waited for these chairs. They're beautiful and pretty comfy too. Seat cushions are on the tighter side. Assembly took a long time but again, worth it. I highly recommend these chairs!", 
    "These parsons chairs are great! Very easy to assemble and super sturdy. We are using them as end chairs on our dining room table and we're so happy with our selection.", 
    "The chairs themselves are really nice, however legs sent were wrong size so one of chairs wobble. There is no customer service number included with order that was very disappointing considering all the money spent on buying household items for the move", 
    "I waited some time for these chairs to show up and ordered four of them for my kitchen. Four of the front legs were missing from the box and called it in. I was assured that they will ship the remaining four front legs. I can't wait to get them so I can assemble and enjoy them. I highly recommend this product.", 
    "Excellent quality and price. easy to assemble. I bought a pair to go as end chairs for my new dining table set and the color and fabric is beautiful. They are not heavy duty but feels solid once assembled.Thank you Overstock!", 
    "I am very happy with my chairs. I did not give it a 5 bc it was a bit tricky on the assembly and they are a bit wobbly. However, for what I paid, it was well worth it. My only real complaint is that they were on back-order for so long. I finally found what I liked and couldn't get it.", 
    "decent quality item for the money", 
    "The chairs were easy to put together and when I put them on my wood floors they were level. Once I put them on my tile floor in the diningroom several of the chairs front legs are off.", 
    "Chairs are beautiful and well crafted. Color was as expected! Chairs are easy to put together and cushions and fabric are very nice!", 
    "I am very, very happy with the price and quality of these chairs. They are tufted beautifully and not so heavy to move around. I'm extremely pleased all around!", 
    "Purchased dark grey chairs along with matching reclaimed upholstered benchs. Comfortable and good quality. Item a little darker than pictured. Very pleased.", 
    "Been waiting a while for these and love how they look in person!", 
    "These chairs look very elegant and contemporary at the same time! However, they were not easy at all to put together...could be that it was me and not my husband doing it but he did attempt to put together one on his own and started swearing (he's baseline impatient anyways)...so, with that being said not the easiest to put together but easy to follow directions and they look great in my home!!!", 
    "Been waiting 2 months for these chairs (light gray) as they were out of stock, worth the wait! Love the look with our farmhouse table (we also ordered the bench in light gray) and they are very comfortable at such a great price!", 
    "They fit my huge dining table perfectly. Love the leather feel.", 
    "I checked the stock on these daily and in the middle of the night. I was fortunate to order the light grey chairs around midnight one evening. After I placed my order they were out of stock. I felt lucky! Assembling the chairs was fairly easy. I had to line up the holes and use the correct screws (per instructions). The light grey is even more beautiful then displayed on the website (not too light and not too dark). Overall I love them!! Thank you Overstock!!", 
    "They go perfect with my customized farm table. Easy to assembly...", 
    "I got beige linen chairs (don't ask how, just was so lucky, cuz within 1hr there were gone). I am very happy with them, the color just exactly how on the picture. It takes a little time to assemble (not that easy but possible). Just would like them a little bit softer, but since we use them only for the big party, i can live with it. For those who is still waiting for them available online to order i can recommend to check World Market, they have EXACTLY the same chairs, much more softer, but.... the price is ** more expansive.", 
    "Love the charcoal grey chairs. Great price. We used for our end chairs for kitchen table with bench. Very happy and speedy delivery. My husband had no problem with assembly. Comfy to sit in. Looks as pictured. Love distressed legs", 
    "The chairs look really great, I got 4 of the dark gray and the color is very similar to the picture (would describe as a charcoal). They are also pretty comfortable and sturdy. However, these were so painful (literally) to assemble. I just bought a ton of new furniture and assembled all of it, and these were definitely the worst. There's not many steps or screws so it's pretty simple, but the screws are so difficult to screw in that my fingers were sore for a week. Took around 2.5 hours with 2 people to do the 4 chairs."
