    "This chair is wonderfully comfortable and easy to use. My friend was seriously injured and needed to stay with me. It was nearly impossible for him to get out of a bed or chair, and he was able to sleep in this recliner. I had been looking for a new recliner anyway, and this one looks great in my shabby chic living room. The small footprint is a bonus. We had it out of the box and fully set up in under 15 minutes. And Overstock delivered it in 3 days. Thank you!"
