    "Benches are now the 'it' thing for a formal dining room setting and I'm so elated that I chose this particular bench to decorate my first formal dining room area. I also chose to mix and match my furniture with different chairs (off white nailhead dining chairs) to compliment this bench and I couldn't have made a better selection. The bench is soft to the touch but firm in seating, which in my opinion is a great combination. You'll love the bench.", 
    "I have two matching wingback chairs and two solid wingback chairs and this bench makes a great addition visually and provide much0needed extra seating without being \"matchy-matchy.\" Wish the cushion was a bit firmer though.", 
    "Modern, elegant, very good quality bench. Sturdy, easy to install. I paired this bench with the Grey Chevron dining chairs and they look very good around any table. The shipping is free and they delivered it in front of the door for me even though it's the 3rd floor but there is an elevator.",

    "Using this bench in our dining room. It arrived quick and was easy to assemble. I wish the wood was darker, looked darker in the images online, but in person it seems lighter. Great height and perfect for the dining room table.", 
    "Simple to assemble. Strong and sturdy. Very comfortable. Perfect match to the Parsons Chairs I purchased.", 
    "The bench is very nice and the zig zag fabric was nicer than in the picture! I only disappointment was that it was a little to long to tuck under the table. Nice construction.", 
    "Works great for a large group and love the contemporary look. Very sturdy.", 
    "it looks good and perfect for small space kitchen.",

    "It is sooo perfect. Easy assembly, very very pretty and fits into my contemporary dining area especially my stainless steel Trumbull dining table, by Inspire Q also. Compliments galore! Chevron print is so pretty I ordered a different Chevron storage bench to match. Love it!", 
    "This bench was perfect when it can. We love it", 
    "Love this new addition to my dining room table.", 
    "We wanted a bench to allow more walk space in our eat in kitchen, so we chose 4 chairs and this bench. Love the look of the bench and it is a space saver, however We did not measure the bench and ASSUMED it would fit under the table. This did not happen sadly. But with a few rearrangements we were able to position the bench in a place that works for us. So be sure to measure to determine if bench will fit under your table, if that is where you intent to place it. Other than that mishap, we love it!", 
    "Great value looks expensive fabric is great",

    "Looks great although not sure it'll sistain everyday use.", 
    "Love this bench. Very sturdy. Simple to assemble.", 
    "Love this accent bench. I have it sitting in front of a large picture window. Light grey/cream cheveron print. Subtle so it won't date. Lots of compliments.", 
    "I was looking for a bench just this height and length for my dining room table. It was totally easy to assemble and looks great!", 
    "The fabric on the bench and chairs are not what the photo lends you to believe. The fabric is a poor density and the colors are more silver and off white. The pictures of the chairs and other accompanying pieces are not reflective of the inexpensive quality and over all look. I should have listened to other reviews and not purchased them. I am so disappointed with that I'm sending them all back. First time I've ever returned an item.", 
    "I truly love this bench!!! I have gotten numerous complements on this bench and it was very easy to assemble."
