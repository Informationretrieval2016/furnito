    "cushions looked good however when sitting they were so poorly filled that you can feel the bottom of the cane chair. Very uncomfortable. I wanted to send them back but they were shrink wrapped and i couldn't fit them in the box. I would still like to return them since I've had to bye other pillows. but don't know how.. Maybe customer service could help. barbara d.", 
    "This is the first review I've written and am doing so now to counter the complaints others have about this product. The cushions look great, are adequately puffy, and sufficiently well made. Really, I got three cushions for the price of one settee cushion elsewhere. The quality is similar to cushions I bought at PierOne.", 
    "Really comfortable cushions available in many color options. I selected the cinnamon which goes well with the deck. The quality is good and makes my deck furniture more appealing. It doesn't look cheap and I've received quite a few compliments on the feel and look of the cushions. Really nice look and feel, I definitely made a good choice.", 
    "We purchased this set to go with a wicker conversation group. The cushions are comfortable and durable.", 
    "I had ordered these cushions to match the cushions I had ordered for the chaise lounges I also bought on Overstock. I saw the Lime color swatch, and decided it would really \"pop\" against the white wicker. The chaise cushions (also in Lime) arrived first, and when I opened the box, I thought there had been a mistake. This \"Lime\" color is actually a sage or celery green, very muted, and not at all what the color looked like (at least on my PC screen) . All have been returned.", 
    "these were used as a replacement for a set of cheaply made outdoor cushions. These make the furniture look much more expensive and the color really pops. Fabric is a good quality and the filling is more than adequate.", 
    "Cleaned up the look on our patio.", 
    "This is not an easy item to find. Great color choices, great price and great quality.", 
    "Haven't had these cushions very long but so far so good. They are comfortable, well made and sturdy. The cushions are thick which is good. Hopefully, these cushions will last a long time. I think they were a good value and Overstock always delivers pretty quickly.", 
    "I purchased these cushions in blue. The blue is more like a dark denim color. They are plush. Working very well to replace a cheaper/thin set purchased with the furniture. I'd definitely recommend them.", 
    "Fluffy! seem very nice. Not the navy I thought it would be. It is more of a dark wash denim.", 
    "Very well made. Would purchase again.", 
    "Loved the color...cushions not as much love. Read the previous reviews and should have paid closer attention. Cushions are not real comfy. Thank goodness I will only use them during months that we can't set outside. But for the price....you get what you paid for.", 
    "Great fit for our ekvker satee set.", 
    "I've been searching for nice cushions and came across these. I was a bit skeptical at first being that you got the whole set for a great price. I'm so glad I took the chance! The cushions are comfortable and look great on my dark brown wicker furniture! It gave my deck that extra pop of color I was looking for and added some mossy green pillows for accent. I couldn't be happier!", 
    "excellent condition and comfortable seating.", 
    "Got these for my wicker patio furniture. I spray painted white wicker furniture with a matte black. These cushions fit perfect and went great with the black color. Its a great summer red color and comfortable.", 
    "We definitely road-tested these cushions on our outdoor furniture this fall but after several rains, they looked completely unscathed and dried within a day or so. They provided a sufficient amount of cushion and the fabric was soft / comfortable to sit on. It does not feel \"industrial.\" I bought a dark, solid color to be \"safe\" but having seen how the fabric performs I wish I would have bought a bolder pattern / brighter shade.", 
    "Nice cushions , but shade very easy in the sun", 
    "A complete value very satisfying", 
    "Perfect fit, color, great quality", 
    "Very happy with the quality and the color. This product exceeded my expectations! It looks amazing with the Wicker set of four in a Walnut color.", 
    "Absolutely love these cushions. I ordered the red (chili) color for my wicker furniture in my Florida room. The color is so vibrant and beautiful; it changed the look of the room. My sister thought I bought new furniture. They are not cheaply made either...very thick and cushy. I looked around for this exact color and set and other places were asking twice as much. So worth the money. Glad I bought them!", 
    "Ordered a set for some patio furniture that was purchased from Lowes with no cushions. Multiple color selection made finding a color match to our overall living color theme in house was easy. PERFECT SIZE. Fit well - no gaps or overhang. Cost was lower than most other sellers,", 
    "LOVE this set! Perfect fit!", 
    "Loved the cushions , just what I was looking for and made very well.", 
    "Great looking nice and puffy", 
    "Good quality for the price, exactly as described. Color match good.", 
    "Nice fabric. Nice cushions. Cleaned well after a bird made a deposit on them.", 
    "This is everything the description says it is. Fits in my home perfect. If your thinking of buying, you should. I bought Two!", 
    "Very durable and excellent quality.", 
    "This product fit my chairs perfectly...at this price they were the best choice ...enjoying them!!!", 
    "bought to use for outdoor party, to replace my cushions for a rental set. Received quickly. Much surprised at the quality and plump cushions. Great value. Yes, I would order again.", 
    "Very comfy and color is perfect", 
    "I should have measured my furniture before I ordered this set. It was too small. But fortunately I had other pieces I could use them with.", 
    "Have had them two seasons now in the upper midwest and they still look good. They are heavy enough that don't slide around much.", 
    "These were well worth the price. Quality and color are true and make this a great deal!", 
    "These are nice cushions but they looked thicker in the pictures.", 
    "I am pleased with my cushions.", 
    "I ordered the navy and it is a nice deep navy color. Have withstood the weather so far very well. Have been outside in the rain/sun for about 3 months now.", 
    "These cushions were really well made and I love them especially for the price!", 
    "The quality is great and I love the color.", 
    "The pads are well made and sturdy.", 
    "These cushions are of a high quality. The fabric is very durable and they are attractive. They don't fit the chairs and bench to a tee but good enough for our purposes. Very comfortable as well.", 
    "Very happy with my purchase", 
    "I love these cushions. The color was as pictured and they are very good quality.", 
    "Looks great on my patio and it is maintaining it's structure even after several months outside. Highly recommend.", 
    "I certainly didnt expect these to be Sunbrella quality but these completed faded within 6 weeks. What a waste! Very disappointed.", 
    "Love the color, matches our adobe tile roof. good price too, however the cushions are fading from the sun! not good.", 
    "They shipped quickly and arrived in a small box. I thought oh no I ordered only chair pads. All 3 items were vacuumed packed. I would recommend buying the cushions.", 
    "I bought these cushions to replace the torn ones I had they are a little smaller and thinner then but they will do the job until I replace the whole furniture set. The color is nice too.", 
    "I would give these 0 stars if I could. They were truly HORRIBLE...CHEAP!!!!!!!!!", 
    "The construction of the cushions is quality. And it is a nice thick cushion. However, even though the cushions are not in direct sunlight all day, they've faded substantially. I would recommend storing these when not in use.", 
    "Sturdy fabric, good cushion level, and deep rich color that so far (all summer, this summer) has been unblemished by sun and that occasional wind driven horizontal rain. Very happy with the purchase.", 
    "Not as firm as Pottery Barn's, but I really like them better. They're not as big and bulky and they're a lot cheaper. I can change the color schemes more often at this price.", 
    "I would not buy these again simply because the tufted design is very lumpy and uncomfortable to sit on. I wish I went with a smooth cushion.", 
    "Perfect, gifted to my children they loved them", 
    "love these cushions...great price", 
    "Love the Pillows!!! Very comfortable", 
    "these were priced well - not very full of cushion like ones I paid 3x's the price of these for. But they are a great price and for outdoor stuff that's improtant", 
    "Super impressed with the price and with the quality of this item. I got the blue and it looks great on my outdoor set. I feel like this is going to last me a few seasons too.", 
    "Just received my order of three cushions for the wicker furniture on my back porch. I am so happy with my purchase!! The items are quality material, the color is exactly what I wanted, and the price is exceptional. I will be ordering from Overstock again.", 
    "The chair cushions are too floppy and fall off the chair. No ties. In fact, I fell off a chair yesterday because of the extra floppy cushion.Color is fine. Wish there were ties to make the cushions stay in place.", 
    "The material feels cheap and despite the fact that the cushions look fluffy there are not well filled.", 
    "Cushions were color as shown .they fit perfectly and very comfortable. Highly recommend", 
    "The original cushions on our outdoor wicker furniture were quite thin and uncomfortable, but these replacements really made a difference. I would recommend these as a reasonably priced solution", 
    "Very nice quality cushions. A less expensive alternative to the *********. Can't comment on how they do in the sun though as mine are under a shaded patio.", 
    "Love these cushions the color is perfect.", 
    "compared to the price at other retailers, this price was a good bargain. Fits our outdoor loveseat and is comfortable.", 
    "I wish these bench cushions were thicker, but especially deeper. They don't reach the front of the seats so I'll need to improvise something to push them forward to the front edge of each seat.", 
    "but this is not a cloth cover...rather more papery", 
    "The cushions are okay, although not as \"comfy\" as I thought they would be. The color was very disappointing; more of a denim color than the beautiful vibrant blue shown online.", 
    "Looked everywhere for the right size. Found it here!", 
    "Great deal for the cushion set !!! Thick and padded - I worried they would be thin for the price but they were exactly what we needed", 
    "Color is true to picture and the cushions are nice and plump", 
    "Look great on front porch rockers!", 
    "Looks beautiful and was exactly what I was expecting!", 
    "Actually, the cushions seem to be holding up pretty well. We have had lots of rain in the past month.", 
    "These cushions are nice and plush. I purchased the bright red paprika color. They are new, so I can't speak to their long-term durability, but so far, I'm loving them.", 
    "I like the looks of these but these are advertised as outdoor cushions and they are NOT--they absorb water like a sponge!I cannot keep them outdoors. I have to put them inside and take them out each time I want to use them. VERY disappointed. These were not cheap. waste of money", 
    "I ordered many of these matching cushions for chairs and benches in my patio area. They are well made and thick. I purchased the cinnamon color and they looked fab with various pillows I purchased separately. My only complaint is that they rapidly faded to a very dull color. Because I did not flip them, next season, I will flip them to the newer looking side. This will give me a good two years of use. This is not a problem for me because I will switch to another color for variety.", 
    "Delivered in 3 days. I could not fine cushions local due to season. I'm very pleased.", 
    "The cushions arrived on time, perfectly packaged and exactly as we hoped for! They are comfortable and fit our furniture beautifully. We couldn't be more pleased with them!", 
    "I like everything about it but it is just a little too small.", 
    "I have been long trying to find cushions this color and you can't beat the price! I am very happy with this purchase!", 
    "Have looked everywhere for outdoor cushions in the fall. Everyone had their off season stock put away so overstock was a lifesaver! Thanks Overstock! Just what I needed for a fresh look on my back porch! :-)", 
    "Decent quality. Very good value. True to pic. The paprika color is vibrant and coordinates well with the other pillow I purchased from overstock even though they are not from the same line.", 
    "This 3 piece set is exactly what I expected. Very comfortable and durable. The color is vibrant. couldn't be happier! Thanks Overstock! You never disappoint!!!", 
    "Worth every penny-I compare sets at pier one that were 3 times the price", 
    "Great Product, fully stuffed, great price. I would purchase again.", 
    "After making some remodeling changes to our Florida room, it was time for some new cushions for our furniture. After looking at many sites, I went to this site and was pleasantly surprised. Many choices, and colors. I found this 3-piece set in exactly the color (wheat) I wanted. The color is definitely richer than picture shown. It looks like I spent a lot of money on it, when in fact, it was quite reasonable. Love, love, love it.", 
    "Very happy with purchase. Actual items and color were true to picture.", 
    "We were lucky enough to find a new condition wicker set at a yard sale, originally sold at **** *****. I immediately wanted new/different cushions. I found these right away on overstock. The color is great, they are very comfortable and weather resistant. We added a couple of bright striped outdoor throw pillows and it looks brand new...we use it everyday. I would definitely recommend this product!", 
    "cushions fit perfectly on my older resin wicker furniture...the color was not quite the \"lemon\" that I expected, but I am very happy with the purchase for such a reasonable price!!!", 
    "Ordered the cushions in paprika - color is great! Cushions are so comfortable and look amazing on my black wicker furniture. These were replacements cushions and are the best quality in terms of style and comfort. I can now actually enjoy sitting on my front porch...just what I wanted.", 
    "Fit my standard size love seat perfectly and look great", 
    "not as much padding as old pillows, but i'm please with them", 
    "These cushions were so small! I bought them to replace cushions on an existing patio furniture set I had bought years earlier. I read the dimensions and thought these cushions would work but when I put them on my loveseat they looked dwarfed! And they were not very cushy. They look really comfortable but the second you sit all the cushion flattens out. I will say Overstock was really fast and speedy with the shipping. I had also done an exchange on these cushions and that was handled very efficiently as well. Anyway probably gonna look for cushions at **** ***** or ****** or something.", 
    "I ordered this for my mother she is very happy with it.", 
    "This was exactly what I expected except that the color brown had more red in it than appeared in the photo. That didn't work with the color of the wicker for which I needed them. The quality was, overall, very good. The stitching looked great, etc. They could have used more stuffing. Based on previous reviews, I knew that would be the case. Nonetheless, they are a really good deal for the price. I sent them back reluctantly, because I will now have to spend more $ to get decent cushions. I wish it had worked out! The return went smoothly and Overstock's customer service was excellent.", 
    "The material is acrylic so it has a stiff feel medium stuffing but holds up to the outdoor element well.", 
    "Great value for the money. Just as nice as cushions I almost ordered somewhere else for half the price!", 
    "It's not heavy material, but perfect for my sun room. And, the color matched perfectly.", 
    "I ordered these in lemon expecting from the picture that they would be a bright yellow. When they arrived I was disappointed to find that they are more of a khaki than a yellow and certainly not bright or cheerful. I haven't actually used them yet as I haven't decided if I am keeping them or not.", 
    "The cushion set is very comfortable with lots of filling inside and I love the color Lime!!", 
    "This set fit my wicker love seat and two chairs perfectly. Love the variety of color choices as well.", 
    "I was not expecting the cushions to be so upscale in the fabric. A true woven weather resistant fabric. Nice rich deep brick red.", 
    "Great color & quality. Looks very nice! Material is thick.", 
    "For the price this is a great buy. The color, paprka, is a very nice shade of red. They're also quite comfortable I would definitely recommend this purhase", 
    "The cushions are made of the best quality components and they are very comfortable and I have received many compliments about the cushions.", 
    "I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE PRODUCT AND SERVICE. IT IS THE FIRST TIME I EVER ORDERED ANYTHING AND I'M GLAD I DID.", 
    "I ordered the avocado cushions for my settee outside. The color is beautiful, not to mention the quality of the product. Comfortable and durable...yet feels like a normal cushion. Not the typical outdoor cushion. Great price!!", 
    "very satisfied with this product, was of good workman ship ,and good material.", 
    "Wish they were stuffed a bit more, but nice. I liked the color and texture.", 
    "I wasn't sure how these would look from ordering them online, but they are beautiful!! They fit perfect, and they are very comfortable. They were packed very well.", 
    "Great cushions. Very comfortable and fluffy. I got the bright line green ones and the color is beautiful. Very well made and a wonderful price. Shipped very fast!", 
    "Cushions fit perfect on glider and add to the nostalgia I was trying to achieve.", 
    "I am very pleased with the cushions, the price was better than any other places I checked and I checked a lot of them. They are just what I was looking for and they are very nice to sit on.", 
    "I purchase these to go with a wicker set I purchased in a mocha color, so I was looking for a red cushion and they are perfect. I'm very pleased that I can purchase a product that is made in a America. Being a small business person myself, this is very important to me. Overstock does it again, they provided a product above my expectations.", 
    "great cushions that fit perfectly... color is exact", 
    "I ordered these cushions in the lime green. They were the best price for the quality and style I hoped for, and I am pleased with them. The lime green really adds some pop and freshness to my front porch without being too bright.", 
    "I purchased these cushions for a wicker patio set. I am very happy with them. They are comfortable, a great price and quality. Really added color to my porch!", 
    "The lime color is fantastic but the cushion was a tad shorter than my wicker love seat. Not your fault I should have measured, it still workes great with the decor.", 
    "Nice cusions but didn't fit my settee at all. I sold them on ebay instead of sending them back.", 
    "these cushions are the best, they add height to the bench and chairs. they add a splash of color to the set.", 
    "I would recommend these to anyone. The material is nice, the density was good and very comfortable to sit on. I do not feel the wicker underneath them as stated by some. Maybe they got a bad batch, unfortunately. We are very pleased with the quality all the way around!", 
    "I received these cushions very promptly. The color was as shown and the quality was what I expected given the reviews. The stuffing material is not dense, as someone has described, so you can feel the wicker beneath them, but they are thick enough to be comfortable and a very good deal for the price. I haven't had them that long so I can't comment yet on their durability.", 
    "The color is fab! The only change I would make if I were the manufacture is that the cushion on all 11 pieces I ordered were to be 5 \" thick. They really flatten when sat on. I would order again as the price is right.", 
    "Very happy with the product. I ordered an extra set of chair cushions and used them as back pillows on the settee. Worked perfect! Super fast shipping, arrived three days after the order was placed.", 
    "They've been rained on a few times. I just hold them vertical and the water runs out. I set them out in a vertical position, and they dry out in a few hours. My old cushions would be wet all day. I love these cushions. When I need replacements, I will try to rebuy this brand.", 
    "Don't buy these cushions. They are so thin, you might as well sit on the ground. I am very disappointed that overstock.com even has them on their website. The only thing good about them is the color was what I was looking for.", 
    "cushions came quickly; intact and good color overall. Can't wait to see if the cushion will stand up to the weather, sun light and rain. :)", 
    "These are very nice and fluff up nicely after the vacuum shipping process. We ordered more after we got these.", 
    "only have had for a month but so far so good. no fading or lumps and dries quickly.", 
    "Nice cushions, color accents white wicker well. My husband was also satisfied.", 
    "I really wanted to love these chair cushions. The color was perfect and the feel of the fabric was pretty good. but they don't seem to be holding up to the outdoors very well. We do take them inside when it rains, but I can tell already that these cushions will not last long, maybe one season. I should have paid the higher price, and bought better quality.", 
    "Great product and color description. Cushions appear to be nice quality.", 
    "looks great and is the same color as the bakcgorund of other chairs cushionns I ordered at the same time.", 
    "This beautiful color looks wonderful on our white wicker. I only wish the cushion was firmer. These cushions make our old wicker look new. I love it.", 
    "I needed to replace some very old cushions and these worked very well. For the price I may change colors more frequently.", 
    "I would highly recommend these outdoor cushions to a friend. The fabric is heavy duty and the thickness of the cushions was more than I expected.", 
    "not enough firmness. shows wear and tear already for intermediate use. use not year round as use them 6 month and then change. they might not make it to next fall season.", 
    "I am pleased overall with the cushions and would order then again.", 
    "These cushions are very comfortable and good quality. They look very nice on our patio chairs.", 
    "This set was the perfect addition to what I already had on my big wraparound porch. The lime color gave what I already had a nice punch of color!", 
    "Quality is average, fabric is not of a nature to withstand continuous outdoor exposure but is okay if stored when not in use. Color is a cherry red not the more \"rusty\" red color inferred by the name paprika. It takes a few days to fluff fully and is comfortable but not a thick padding. Would recommend with precautions on expectations.", 
    "they were just the right color and texture i was hoping for.", 
    "I would not advise this product due to the way that it has faded over the last few weeks.", 
    "These came quickly and I love the color, the soft muted mocha is a perfect match to what I wanted for my outdoors chairs!", 
    "These look great and are very comfortable to sit on. They fit perfectly on my chairs and were very true to size. I've only had them a few weeks, so I don't know how they'll hold up long term, but so far they've withstood rain storms and sunlight.", 
    "I received the cushion set yesterday and was all excited to get my screened-in porch all decorated. Unfortunately the color does not go. On the website, it's called \"Papprika\" but it should really be \"Cherry Red\". So I'm sending them back today. It's difficult to really evaluate a color on the website. It did look more rust color to me on the website. Oh well....the quality seemed good and they were very cushy and material seemed like it would hold up.", 
    "My communication with SelectBlinds and the product were superb. Thank you!"
