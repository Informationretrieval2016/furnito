    "These chairs were an excellent purchase and a beautiful addition to our dining room look. I was looking for armless chairs that would compliment the very expensive head chairs that I purchased-in fact, they were so expensive that I was forced to restructure my dining room look and go elsewhere for the rest of the chairs! These fit the bill. The fabric has a 3d look & the colors look rich & inviting. I am very happy & my hisband had no issues putting them together.", 
    "Nice chairs, comfortable and attractive. Seem to provide good support. Relatively easy to assemble, all required parts and tool included. Pattern is classic. Fabric is demask 3 tone thread. Blue color thread is slate color and feels like a chenille. Overall back ground color is a dark chocolate and the third thread color is a milk chocolate color, that adds dimension. Overall the fabric is beautiful and quality. On the chair fronts the pattern is aligned in the center but on the back of the chairs the fabric pattern is not centered. I bought 6 chairs and only 2 have the chair backs patterns centered. There is piping on the backs which helps to make up for the off centered pattern. Only one of the chairs has a staple visible on the back. The chair feet are rubber-like and are adjustable. Overall, a comfortable and attractive looking chair for the price.", 
    "I labored for weeks trying to decide whether to order these chairs for my dining room... worrying if they would be good enough quality and if they would match. Well!!!!... was I thrilled when I opened the box! The quality is exceptional....the seat cushions are about 5\" thick and the detail welting around the back of the chair is beautiful...an added detail like you find in more expensive furniture. The 2 chairs were shipped in 1 box & it took me 15-20 mins to put together with allen wrench provided. You will not find a buy like this in any store!", 
    "I purchased 8 of these chairs and am so glad I did!! Very easy to assemble, very sturdy. Colors are slightly grayer than blue which is exactly what I wanted, fabric is lovely, wood tones of chair legs blend nicely with mahogany table. Seat backs and padded seats are comfortable and supportive, not creaky or flimsy. My family loves these chairs!", 
    "I was expecting blue and brown. They look more like gray and brown. I did keep them. I thought they were a good value and they did blend in with my d\u00e9cor. Took only minutes to put together, once out of the box.", 
    "These are the chairs I was looking for exactly. Thank you Overstock for bringing such great items for us to enjoy. My dining room has never looked so great. The colors are perfect. Fabulous!!!!!", 
    "The fabric is basically grey and dark brown but it was a perfect match for me. The chairs are well made and went together easily. The pattern is centered on the front and just a tweak off on the back. Acceptable unless your extremely particular. The cushion is firm and the depth of the seat is very good. They are excellent parson's chairs for the money.", 
    "They were very easy to assemble. The only issue I has was with a broken chair level and I contacted customer service and they took care of it. I'm very pleased!", 
    "I was weary of ordering these chairs from just seeing them online. I was afraid of quality and color. The chairs were delivered quickly and are amazing! I love the fabric color and detail on the back. The quality is very high end and exceeded my expectations.", 
    "Look, I am very picky when it comes to shopping for furniture and I must say, these are very good chairs for the price- a steal, in fact. Good job Overstock!", 
    "I searched for dining room side chairs for months. These were beautiful, sturdy and very well priced. I loved them and my friends raved :", 
    "These chairs for the price are great. Nice color, comfortable seat. Work so nicely with existing furniture I am tempted to order two more. Love them.", 
    "These chairs are so high end looking and super comfortable. Took me no time at all to assemble.", 
    "I'll start off by saying that if the chairs came assembled, they'd get 5+++ stars from me, no question. But there were a couple of minor challenges of putting the chairs together: - The screws, bolts, washers, etc came in a loosely tied plastic bag, and some of the parts were floating around in the box - if they hadn't fallen out of the box altogether - Some of the wood that you had to screw together left a little to be desired (crappy pieces-parts were used for some of the chair frames)But once the chairs were put together, they're AWESOME! Here are the positives: - They look a lot more rich in person - They're comfortable - They're sturdy - I have some 'larger' people in my family, and there have been no issues - They're not bulky - The color of the chairs is beautiful - The pattern of all of the chairs is EVEN. I ordered 12 chairs total, and they match perfectly. All in all, I'd order these all over again. After getting through the assembly-bumps, they are well worth the money.", 
    "with what I was trying to do. As some have said - the blue is a gray in my opinion which is just what I wanted. They are a bit of a pain to get the alan wrenches work well. The wood under there looks pretty cheap. Sure hope they last for 5 years...we shall see.", 
    "Look great and comfortable, too. Agree with other reviewers, I would not call the chairs blue, more of a green-cast but the overall color is brown. Nice solid wood legs.", 
    "Very pretty chairs, great value! I am very impressed, thanks Overstock. I would say they are a little more green than blue.", 
    "Good quality chairs and fabric, but the colors are brown and green; not blue and brown as shown.", 
    "Initially I was worried realizing AFTER I had ordered these chairs, that they would be TOO 'blue'... in the photo they looked to be more light green. Well when they arrived I was completely relieved, because they are GREEN and that is the color I was going for. So if you want blue and brown, beware, they are more light green and brown and absolutely gorgeous. Only glitch in the order was the fact that the BOLT packet wasn't inside the shipment. But the Overstock.com customer service took care of that issue and immediately shipped the bolt package. One thing every customer should know about Overstock.com is that their 'Customer Service' team is the best on-line customer service I have EVER dealt with. Their follow through and follow up is impeccable. I really wish they had a special section to review that part...because they are simply awesome.", 
    "Beautiful chairs that look great as additional seating in my living room with occasional use as extra seating in the dining room.I would not call them \"Blue and Brown\" though as I can find no blue in them. Shades of brown and tan is more accurate.", 
    "Elegant chairs for my dining room. In my first order I purchase 4 sets. But becouse my dining table ls big I purchase another 2 sets. Nice color, much with my dining table and dining room wall colors it is comfortable and very light. I wish the way its nice same way it's will long resist. It is too soon to speak about quality.", 
    "Just finished assembling the chairs. They were easy to assemble with a bit of patience match8ing up the screws to the holes. No extra tools required. They seem well padded. The color is pale blue/brown...extremely pretty. Replacing heavy pine furniture, I knew that the quality of construction of these chairs would not be the same. The \"wood\" that is used to construct these chairs seems to be some type of pressed wood if that tells you anything. Having said that, for my purposes, the price, and with gentle use, I think they will hold up for a while. I am glad I bought them.", 
    "Love my two chairs. Look expensive, and they have nice fabric.", 
    "When you get up from sitting on these chairs the stuffing has compacted in the front. The upholstery is then crushed and there is a crease left in the material. It does not return to it's original condition over time.", 
    "I Love these chairs. I'm thinking of getting another set. I did not put them together ,my husband did.I was out of town when they arrived. He told me ,It was a piece of cake putting them together. The second chair went way faster about 20 min. I love how they look and feel.Sturdy comes to mind.", 
    "These chairs are lovely. The color background is an green/gray on the real side of green. Perfect for my needs. They are comfortable cushioned chairs. Don't expect anything heavy - these are fairly lightweight. They arrived quickly, partially assembled. Just make sure you use the correct size screw in the right place. There are 3 or 4 screws close in size to assemble with - not too difficult. The legs did a few small nicks and one small gauge upon arrival but a touch up stick took care of covering the spots All & all I am very happy with the fabric, the comfort and the color. We ordered 4 to use in our dining area around an antique round table. Great look!", 
    "Comfortable. Not blue and brown, though, it's green and brown. Doesn't match my decor. Will have to sell and by different chairs.", 
    "Very pleased with the look and feel.", 
    "These chairs were absolutely perfect. They are beautiful and extremely comfortable. We haven't gotten a ton of use out of them, but so far, so good.", 
    "These chairs are beautiful, comfortable, easy to put together and affordable. I have a three year old and a one year old that has been using them for about 3 months and they are holding up well!The color is a grey/blue.", 
    "We use them for our bedroom office space and they are comfy and cute.", 
    "Color leans green. Quality structure & design", 
    "These chairs look very nice and the fabric is soft and comfortable. The quality seems good after owning them for a month.", 
    "Ordered these chairs to go with new table. The blue was a bit different that expected, but had planned on new paint in that room regardless. The whole thing turned out great!", 
    "Chairs are a lovely color of brown and blue. Match perfectly to my corner area.", 
    "The thread color is much more like sea green. The chairs are lightweight but very comfortable. Great value for price. But are not blue.", 
    "I like the chairs, they look nice, seem sturdy and I like that you can adjust (slightly) the leg length at the bottom, but they are a pain to put together!", 
    "Wanted this color for a small tea table arrangement they look great.", 
    "The colors and fabric are very nice. They are small though.", 
    "I love this dining chair! Complemented the sage leaf pattern perfectly! Very comfortable and stylish. Easy assembly!", 
    "These chairs are so comfortable and much nicer in person.", 
    "I bought these chairs because they looked nice and were very inexpensive and I could not be happier. They are comfortable and well made, I don't think they will last for years but they look great!", 
    "We ordered these for a casual round dining table. They are more sage than blue, which is perfect for us. Very happy with the purchase.", 
    "I ordered six of these chairs and they are nice , they look good in my dining room. They are the color that I needed. I also like the way they sit..", 
    "i was hoping for a little bit more with the fabric, it just looks rather dull. But nonetheless we still have them and they get the job done!", 
    "You have to be careful about the carpet you are trying to match them with. The pattern is aittle busy. I put them in the corners of my dinning room and they look great b", 
    "I'm a bit disappointed. One of the legs is a bit uneven. The chairs are also very uncomfortable after 10 minutes or so.", 
    "I'm using these as side chairs/extra dining room seating. The colors were exactly what I needed, and they were easy to assemble.", 
    "Look great. Easy to assemble.", 
    "Good quality. Easy to put together. Slim.", 
    "Love these chairs. They were just the right size to add to my other 6 chairs at my dinning table. Great for Christmas dinner.", 
    "The damask chairs are brown not blue. What I like about them is that they are light and easy to move. I gave the chairs 4 stars instead of 5 because one of the seats sounded like it was filled with plastic. To their credit, the manufacturer sent me a replacement. The chairs require assembly.", 
    "The chairs were fairly easy to put together, seem very sturdy, are very comfortable and look great, especially for the price. I am very happy with this purchase.", 
    "I love my new chairs. They go perfectly in my new dining room. They add a touch of elegance and are very sturdy.", 
    "The chairs are easy to assemble -- all you have to put together is the seat and the two front legs. The fabric is high quality and the cushion is comfortable for hours of enjoyment with friends and family.", 
    "Nice chairs and good price!", 
    "Sturdy comfortable chair. Looks as advertised. Slim not bulky. Easy assembly. Wood on inside of one chair where pieces connect is slightly imperfect with knobbed wood. We'll see if the connection lasts.", 
    "Comfortable upholstery and lovely fabric! Perfect for the dining room table that I was looking to style up. Nice medium to dark color wood that would match many looks. Exactly what I wanted!", 
    "Beautiful and very comfortable! Excellent quality. Couldn't be more pleased! Not blue as in title- which is better!", 
    "The chairs are darker than the pic ... other than that they are beautiful!!", 
    "Chairs are a sage and brown color. For the price, they are wonderful and they are very comfortable. Love them!", 
    "We purchased a total of 6 chairs.The material for all chairs matched perfectly. Easy to assemble. The price was great compared to other chairs that we looked at of lesser quality. Great buy would purchase again.", 
    "The quality is very good with this chair, but the seat is quite small to fit an average sized bottom. We are not plus-sized people, yet our bottoms fill the whole bottom of this seat. If you're petite or ***, this might be the chair for you. (We would have returned them because of the size, but after the hours it took us to put them together, we didn't want to take them apart!) Regarding the color, there is absolutely no blue in this fabric; it's brown and green.", 
    "The chairs are beautiful, delivery was prompt, and assembly almost easy, considering my ineptitude. A very overweight friend sat comfortably, so I can attest to the chairs' sturdiness. Buying them was a good decision on my part.", 
    "These chairs were ordered to replace some antique chairs I never truly liked to go with my round antique table. they were not difficult for my husband to assemble. One chair was missing a washer for a bolt screww but my husband had one in his shop. They look lovely in my dining room and are very comfortable to sit in for dinner or games. Recommend.", 
    "Not mistakable for high end but very pretty...easy to assemble but not for ongoing use.", 
    "The chairs are beautiful and match very well with the table we already had. They make out eating space look very elegant and look more costly than they are. My only issues are the instructions for putting them together were a little unclear and after having them for about a month we need to tighten them up because the back is a little wobbly on two chairs (maybe they need stronger nails or maybe we did something wrong when putting them together)", 
    "Great price. Really comfortable. Very solid. Have already used them for a dinner party. Got great reviews from guests.", 
    "The price was perfect; the look was perfect. This set of 2 chairs complemented my other brand dining table and chairs very nicely. While one chair was easily assembled, the other was not. The second chair screw alignment was a bit off and took two of us securely put together. However, I do recommend these chairs for comfort and style - just be ready to patiently assemble them.", 
    "Very pleased with these chairs. The fabric is good quality and assembly was quick.", 
    "Love ,love these chairs!!! Wish I had a dining room table and I would have purchased more. The chairs are so beautiful and so comfortable . Purchased for my bedroom marble desk and it looks so elegant. My room is brown and beige~ and I'm so in love with how they just go with the room. They claim its blue and brown ~ Can't really see it....Looks brown , beige~ but because I have a brown beige comforter I see the slight difference but you would never know...Chairs were easy to put together .... well one was lol... One took less than 15mins, the other unfortunately had that one screw that would not corporate but with patience it did. Looking for a wood dining room table and when I do ~ I will be purchasing more of these chairs!", 
    "I bought these for occasional use and they fit the bill very well. They are well made and go together very easily!", 
    "Absolutely beautifully made and easy to assemble. They look fabulous in the dining room. Great value for the luxury look and feel of these chairs.", 
    "These chairs are even better in person. The upholstery on them was amazing and the legs are beautiful. They were easy to put together and they are extremely elegant and sturdy I want more of them.", 
    "Classy chairs matched the Four Tribecca Parson chairs I had purchasedsome time ago. The blue was very dull, unless they were in the sunlight.However a GREAT effect in my dining area, very pleased indeed!!!!!!", 
    "I was not disappointed and very satisfied. With the Holidays delivery was fast", 
    "These are the perfect size & the are comfortable for people of all sizes. Nice chocolate brown color-the blue is true to the photo. Pleased with this purchase!"
