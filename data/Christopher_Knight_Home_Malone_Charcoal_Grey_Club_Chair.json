    "I ordered two of these chairs for my front room on a Thursday and received them at my front doorstep at around 8:00 a.m. on the following Tuesday. They came in excellent condition and well packaged. My teenager assembled them with no problem whatsoever in only a few minutes. Assembly consisted of inserting the back of the chair into the base and screwing on the legs. They were exactly what I wanted, which was an upscale looking, classic chair that is not too bulky because I have limited space in that room. The arms are thin, which is what I wanted, yet the bottom cushion is thicker and comfortable. The cushion on the seat has velcro on the bottom so it stays secure. If you want a chair where you can flip the cushion, this is not that chair. The bottom side of the cushion is black fabric with velco on each end to keep it secure. The silver studs and the black legs look very upscale, as well as the tufting and the gray fabric. I love these chairs because I I wanted something that looked way more expensive than they were--these fit the ticket perfectly. The color is perfect as well for my purpose. I couldn't be happier...they are a great looking chairs for the price and quite comfortable.", 
    "I looked long and hard for a chair with these dimensions. I'm 5'3\", and the top of the chair hits me just above my neck. The arms are at a comfortable level, and height is good. The depth of the seat if a little long, but I put a lumbar pillow and fits me perfectly. My 5'11\" partner also finds it comfortable, but it doesn't support his head. The medium-dark grey linen fabric and shiny silver nail heads give this old fashioned style a refreshing new and masculine look. I've owned the chair for about 2 months, sit in it for prolonged periods and find it very comfortable. Assembly was a cinch, just pop in the back and screw in the lags. Since the chair is positioned in the middle of the room, I find the back to be somewhat disconcerting because it is not solid and the division of where the top meets the bottom is kind of awkward. It seems sturdy enough, but I doubt this will become a family heirloom. Overall, I'm pleased with the purchase and like the chair a lot.", 
    "Nice little side chair. Seat and back are on the firm side, so it's not a chair you want to sink into and spend hours in. Rich charcoal grey, nice tufting and leg detail make this a sharp accent chair. Size is good for smaller spaces like a small apartment, bedroom or office.", 
    "These chairs are beautiful. But that's where it ends. They are comfortable if you sit on them for a few minutes at a time. Fine for an occasional chair in the bedroom but not for a chair that you sit and watch TV in. After about only 15 to 20 minutes of sitting in the chair you will feel like you're sinking in the middle. I have already had to put a board under the cushion after only having the chair for a week. I weigh 200 pounds so I'm a little heavy but not huge for a guy. It's amazing that you can no longer find quality made furniture.", 
    "We have a gray decor throughout a couple of rooms in our place. The problem with items listed as charcoal - there are tints. This item has a greenish tint to it. We viewed the pictures on different computer screens and none of them matched the item we received. If you don't have other gray pieces in your home and this is an accent piece - it its a solid deal for the price. The back of the chair slips into place, which was a bit surprising because there are no latches or anything that keeps it in besides gravity. We returned our item because of the color. If the color worked out better for our decor, we'd have kept the chair. The style is extremely interesting and works well with other pieces of furniture, as long as the colors match.", 
    "This chair is amazing. I would say \"amazing for the price\" but it is amazing for any price, even if it had cost more. This chair is a smaller scale chair, but not micro or tiny. It would only be small in comparison to huge, overstuffed furniture. I had a wing-back style chair in my living room for years that I am replacing with this Malone club chair - and the Malone club chair made my wing-back chair look very narrow and small in comparison when they were sitting side-by-side. In fact I was impressed by the size of this chair, considering other reviewers had noted it was on the \"small side\". I disagree. I think it is an average size chair. It's very sturdy, solid in construction and looks great in any decor. The neutral grey is true to the picture and works well with my other living room furniture, which is mostly tan and brown. This is the kind of chair that is perfect without all the frills of toss pillows and cloth throws. It stands out on it's own, with a beautiful button-tufted seat cushion, tufted back and shiny silver nailhead trim. And the chair is comfortable and roomy enough for anyone, in my view. My chair arrived well packaged and in perfect condition - no damage to any of the parts. I don't think I could be more pleased. I ordered one of the last 3 Malone club chairs available here on Overstock using some of my tax refund and now they are out of stock. I am so glad I got mine! Five stars!", 
    "Chair arrived sooner than expected and was easy to assemble. The color is medium dark grey, more masculine with stylish silver upholstery tacks. Chair fits my d\u00e9cor and taste very well and I am very pleased . The seat and back are firm. This will be an accent chair in the parlor, for occasional use.", 
    "This chair is really cute, the color is a really beautiful gray/taupe, and I really like the fabric. Seems like it will hold up well. I don't like that the back and bottom come boxed separately and when you put them together, there are two separate pieces instead of the usual smooth back. I would not recommend these to my clients who would use these with the backs facing into the room. I would only use them with the backs facing the wall.", 
    "Great-looking chair and so comfortable! Assembly was easy and they look and feel great! Perfect for a small space, but large enough for my 6'4\" husband to sit comfortably in. What a deal, especially for the price!", 
    "The packaging was carefully boxed which I appreciated. It only takes one strong person to unload and assemble the chair. Fabric is strong and the color is just about the same online, probably even better. You assemble by screwing on legs, and inserting the backrest; the seat cushion sits on velcro. The chair is pretty firm, but I don't think it's made for long term sitting, but it's not uncomfortable. The armrests are a little stiff, but you don't realize it after a few minutes. I don't have any cons to write about except one little one.. I would like the armrests to be wider to be able to sit a laptop computer on or to rest myself while reading a book. But that's preference, not defect. Well made chair, looks great and sturdy enough that you don't feel like you will break it. (speaking as a larger person).", 
    "The chair itself was perfectly fine for the price however the color that is shown and described as Charcoal Grey is more of a Moss Green, does not look grey at all\u2026.Overstock is usually pretty good with their product descriptions but definitely not with this one. Very disappointed in this purchase and now have to return the item for an additional cost.", 
    "I really do like the style of this chair and how well made it is. It came packaged very nicely. My entire family thinks it adds great class and style to our living room. It is comfortable enough for me to read a book in but not a chair you can curl up in and take a nap. I gave it 4 stars out of 5 only because of the color. It is much darker than pictured. And much darker than where I first saw it on a blog. The charcoal is a key word here. It truly is like charcoal grey. Not black by any means but it's dark. It's not a light grey for sure. Maybe there were different dye lots with the fabric. Or maybe it's lighting. Overall I am very pleased with the chair though. We like it well enough to keep. And I have enough dark accents of rod iron in the room to make it work. I am overall very happy with the chair. If you are buying, just keep in mind the color is darker...at least on mine.", 
    "So much better than I thought it would be considering the price tag. The chair is exactly as it looks in the picture. LOVE this chair.", 
    "We wanted a small reading chair for our bedroom and found this one of overstock. Really lovely, comfortable, and an amazing value. Shipped quickly and securely and as other reviewers say, it was easy to assemble (< 5 minutes). We have received so many compliments and it absolutely fits what we needed. Exceeded expectations.", 
    "I really like the chair and the upholstered part of the chair seems very well made and great quality. The legs are going to be the thing to watch, they could be a little more sturdy. Overall looks great in my bedroom!", 
    "I love this. It's a little small but the quality is nice and I feel like it's well worth what I spent.", 
    "I love this chair as far as looks and quality. SO easy to put together. No tools required! 4/5 due to comfort. Its a very stiff chair... not a comfy cozy snuggle up and read a book kind of chair.", 
    "Cute chair, smaller side, average to good made - cant have a lot of wear and tear- cute for low use corner!", 
    "This is such a great chair, especially for the price! I love all the details, from the nail heads to the tufted back to the beautiful curved legs and neutral soft fabric. This was the easiest chair to put together I've ever done. Honestly, it took longer to break down the box it came in.", 
    "Love this chair. Nice fabric. Comfortable.", 
    "Very sturdy and high quality. Deep, firm cushion that will last a long time. Quality fabric and craftsmanship. Great price. Highly recommend!", 
    "Beautiful chair with minimal to no padding in the seat at all. Would not recommend.", 
    "Bought as an accent chair, love it lots of compliments", 
    "It's a comfortable chair love it!!!!", 
    "This is such a cute chair. I ordered it for my teenage daughters room as a surprise, and she has absolutely loved it. It has the look of a much more expensive chair. It does sit a bit firm, but she finds it very comfortable. I looked at a similar style chair in a local store for about 3 x the cost. Very happy with the purchase.", 
    "I love it, right size for my small space but still roomy to sit in ( i can btong my kegs up into the seat for reading.) Grey color is lighter than what i would call charcoal so be aware that reviews are all ovet with the color so if you need super specific grey you might be disappointed. Very strong, my teenager sat on the arm while i wad in the chair reading no problem. I put it together in 5 minutes.", 
    "Very sophisticated chair. As other reviewers noted, very firm seat. We added a brightly colored pillow for a little extra lumbar support, but overall very pleased with it.", 
    "I bought two of these for my family room. They're really cute and add the look I wanted however, they aren't at all comfortable. I accepted this possibility before they even came so I'm okay with it. Good budget chair. You can't have it all at this price range!", 
    "Great transitional piece. Very substantial piece for a great price.", 
    "Great style. Masculine fabric, feminine details makes this a great chair for the bedroom. Firm seating and the size is for average/smaller stature people (5'5-5'9). Looks great and easy to put together.", 
    "We currently have this in the corner of our bedroom. Looks great with a small multicolored pillow. Easy to assemble and move. Very happy with this purchase.", 
    "Perfect accent chair for our home office. Love it! The color and picture matches the picture perfect. It arrived very fast", 
    "Just love these chairs, look great in my formal living room", 
    "Very pretty, easy to put together and very good for the price", 
    "chairs were much darker than they looked on the monitor. Very easy to assemble-snap, click, and done.", 
    "Couldn't be happier, lovely chair and easy to esemble", 
    "Nice fabric and easy to put together. We use these in a harth area and are perfect. I wouldn't recommend theses for an area of high use because they are not as sturdy as some chairs but overall a great deal for the price.", 
    "The legs do not secure tightly enough, making for a wobbly unstable chair. I had to return it.", 
    "I bought two of these chairs and have had no issues with them. They are a greenish grey, but with a linen look to them. They are firm so if you are looking for a chair you will sink in to these are not what you are looking for. Very easy to put together.", 
    "We have a pool table in our formal living room. I wanted a little more of a sophisticated look and this finished it off. It is the perfect size to have a presence but not overwhelming. It is not the most comfortable chair but works perfect for our needs. Very easy to assemble. I was scared after reading some reviews stating it has a green tinge. I can slightly see it in certain lighting but it is not enough to take away from the \"gray\" appearance.", 
    "comfy and well made, really interesting packaging and super easy to put together.", 
    "the chair arrived with a partially damaged box but was okay because it was wrapped in plastic but it smelled horrible I had to have it cleaned and that still didn't help I finally left it outside for 5 days and the smell is a little better. No help from my call to customer service.", 
    "It was a little smaller than I anticipated but we LOVE it. Great color, sturdy and look more expensive than it was! Would buy it again!", 
    "Not heavy but not small as other people mention. Bought a pair, look great together.", 
    "So quick and easy to put together. Just a nice accent chair!", 
    "Love it! It pairs well with a darker grey couch with matching ottoman, and yellow/cream/grey/lt grey/brown area rug (all from Overstock!).", 
    "Love it!!! looks super chic on my living room", 
    "Love these chairs. They are in my sitting room off the kitchen and work perfect. They aren't too large", 
    "Looks nice, not cheap at all. But as far as an object to comfortably sit on...look elsewhere.", 
    "So nice took less than five minutes to put together", 
    "These are nice, but smaller than expected. I ended up switching them out with something else after about 30 days. Great for bedroom or smaller space. Too small for great room.", 
    "After looking for an occasional chair many places, I selected this and it is exactly what I wanted. It is not overly large and the gray fabric was perfect. These chairs are not meant for larger people as they are on a smaller size but this was perfect for the space I intended and assembly was very easy.", 
    "These are sturdy and attractive. I would have rated it excellent except that the directions for attaching the legs were mislabeled. It was difficult removing the legs to correct the error. But, all' s well that ends well.", 
    "lots of things to love about this chair. great details, nice stitching, easy assembly. this chair has withstood a baby, 90 lb german shepherd, and a gamer husband. very comfortable without the bulk.", 
    "Easy to put together, comfy for a bigger person.", 
    "Recently reorganized my study/work/tv room and was given a chair for me, but the chair I had for extra seating did not match and was not the most comfortable. The \"Malone\" is a perfect match, especially the front \"turned\" legs and the upholstery color is perfect. Very comfortable, easy to assemble, and the size is just perfect in a smaller room. Thank you!", 
    "Good sized for my small room. Not comfortable. But priced right for staging home to sell.", 
    "I get soo many compliments on these chairs. Great purchase! They look chic and expensive.", 
    "This chair is not as light gray as pictured. It is a very dark gray/charcoal color. Much darker than the chair pictured.", 
    "I was surprised how beautiful this chair is. I ordered 2. The color is a deep tone of grey. Not too big or small. I would highly recommend this chair.", 
    "Very nice made very nice especially for the cost...GREAT VALUE !!!", 
    "THIS CHAIR FITS PERFECTLY IN MY TOWNHOUSE. THE COLOR IS MORE OF A CHARCOAL GRAY WITH SOME BLACK.EASY TO ASSEMBLE AND LOOKS LIKE I SPENT MORE $ THAN I ACTUALLY DID. VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE", 
    "THIS CHAIR FITS PERFECTLY IN MY TOWNHOUSE. THE COLOR IS MORE OF A CHARCOAL GRAY WITH SOME BLACK.EASY TO ASSEMBLE AND LOOKS LIKE I SPENT MORE $ THAN I ACTUALLY DID. VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE", 
    "Easy assemble, comfortable and classic", 
    "Color is accurate. Chair is cute if you are not looking for an upscale design (one can tell it is a cheap chair once it is assembled, but it certainly is not an eye sore). Perfect for our staging needs, and for apartment/small condo living. Very quick and easy assembly. Good quality overall", 
    "Bought this for the bedroom, looks beautiful, great blue/grey color and comfortable. Highly recommend", 
    "This chair is beautiful and exactly as it looks in the picture. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is the cushion is pretty thin. It is quite firm, though, so I'm hoping it will last decently.", 
    "I really like the design and the color. We have had them about 6.5 months and they are looking worn already. Not a good chair for everyday use. For the money, they are fine.", 
    "easy to assemble, seems sturdy enough. Trim gives it a bit of pizzazz.", 
    "I was hesitant to order furniture without having seen it in real life but I took the plunge. Chair arrived one day earlier than promised. Assembly was easy. Nice fabric, great detailing with the nail heads, and pretty good quality overall. My only complaint was that it's a lot smaller than I thought it would be (from reading other reviews, it was hard to tell). It will work perfect in my formal living room, but not as the comfy chair I had intended it to be for my husband. If you're looking for a nice looking accent chair for a small scale living room that looks pricier than it actually was, then go for it!", 
    "Chair is exactly as pictured. Very modern but has traditional styling as well. Very pleased with product. Easy to assemble. Seat is not a 'cushy' type chair so if you're looking for a lounger you may want to make a different choice. We are using in a bedroom and is perfect.", 
    "Wonderful chair for my bedroom. Looks just like the photo on the site. Lovely gray fabric. Easy to assemble.", 
    "Love the looks of this chair. It is exactly what I was looking for. The color was very accurate a deep charcoal. Love it!", 
    "I ordered 2 of these chairs, and am very happy with them. Shipped quickly and packing was outstanding. They are firm - which I like, they are a true dark gray color, not blue or silver, and they look high end for the price. The fabric is sturdy, not super soft, but seems like it will hold up. Easy to put together, I had both of them done in less than 30 minutes. Seat is held in place by Velcro but can be removed to reposition it or vacuum under, it is not reversible however. Overall they get an A!", 
    "We had already purchased a couple of years ago the leather tufted Christopher Knight chair so when I saw this was the same brand I knew I could trust it. It is very comfortable and well made. I sit it in all the time!", 
    "I bought two of them for my store as accent chairs, not really meant to be sat on. I was very impressed by the quality and how easy they were to be put together. Everyone who has seen them always compliments how nice they look. They are comfortable but personally i feel they are definitely not meant to be sat in for hours at a time.", 
    "Love my chairs! They are better in person, online does not do them justice", 
    "Absolutely beautiful arm chairs. Great accent to the room. Beautiful color. Great fast shipping.Thank you! : )", 
    "The chairs came quickly and they were very easy to put together. They are the exact color shown on the screen. They are moderately comfortable. I'd added a lumbar pillow to offset any firmness. Would say they are worth the price and look great.", 
    "Love this chair! Perfect for a guest room. Easy to put together and looks way more expensive than it costs.", 
    "We really like the chairs - they are a good size, not too bulky, and for the price - the material can't be beat. We have seen similar chairs in high-end catalogs for 3 times the price so we know we got a good deal. The color is nice, and there are a few loose threads that I snipped, but all in all they are great.", 
    "I LOVE THIS CHAIR. IT IS CONFORTABLE AND STYLISH FOR MY FAMILY ROOM.", 
    "DISCLOSURE: Don't buy these thinking they'll go with a grey room. They're more of a aqua-grey. Very pretty - if you love blue tones, but they do not look like the grey shown in th picture. I have them in my office at work and everyone enjoys coming to sit in them. They're very comfortable, not too low to the ground, and I steadily get complimented on how nice they are.", 
    "This chair is tiny, suitable for a small child or pet. It appears 10 larger in photo than it actually is in person. Do not get this chair if you are looking for something functionable for your living room.", 
    "its blue/green not charcoal grey. i waited weeks for it to be back in stock. it looks great in the picture. not the color i expected.", 
    "I love the color (true charcoal gray) and styling. The tufting and silver studs really \"make\" this chair. I bought two and they are in the living room which is only used when company is over. The chairs are rather firm, which is fine for the location. The fabric looks like linen. The chairs arrived quickly and in good condition. It takes more time to take them out the the box and break the box down than it does to assemble. Just snap on the back and screw on the legs. They look great.", 
    "Very niece piece, but I expected something a bit bigger and a bit fancier. But the price was good enough and the material nice. It came all assembled what I really appreciated.", 
    "Rather small for a living room. Best suited for a bedroom side chair or in a sitting room. It's not the best item I've purchased from O but I can make use of it. If I would have seen it in person, I wouldn't have purchased it.", 
    "I just received these chairs this week and they are beautiful. They are very stylish and just the look that I have been searching for. The size, color and details are very true to image on the website. I rely heavily on customer reviews to determine my purchases so I felt compelled to write a review of this item .I am very happy with this purchase. If you are on the fence about these, don't hesitate. You will be very pleased with them.", 
    "We were so very pleased when this chair arrived! The assembly took two people but went well. It adds exactly the comfort and style we needed in our room. We could not be more pleased! The picture on line was somewhat different and showed what seemed to be a softer seat, but we like the firmness which was a nice surprise.", 
    "I really like the style of this chair and the color but the upholstery is lumpy in spots and not so well done. material feels thin and looks and feels like it wont last. i like the studs but they are in a weird pattern in the back which makes it look like collapsable furniture. the chair looks small with my other furniture and definitely would not hold a larger person.", 
    "Perfect color, size and detail. Love the silver studs. Love the fabric texture. The fabric looks better than the picture. Overall I am very pleased with this chair.", 
    "This chair is simply perfect for my space. It is sturdy and I love the color ! This is the second Christopher Knight purchase I have made. His stuff is terrific !", 
    "I love Overstock and this purchase was no exception. The chairs look fantastic in our 'lounge' area of our home. They have added a level of sophistication, without being too stuffy.", 
    "Very happy with my purchase. Color was a true charcoal grey, no green or blue undertones. It looks great in our newly decorated guest bedroom.", 
    "these are great chairs, they look expensive and were not.....easy assembly and the fabric is exactly the grey/ slate I needed. It was a hard color to find.", 
    "This is a really nice chair that is very comfortable and stylish. I was concerned about the quality of the fabric prior to purchasing it but upon arrival, noted that the quality was to a high standard. Overall, a good piece of furniture that is worth the money.", 
    "I really like the nail-head trim and the fabric of these. They are very neutral, dark enough not to show stains, but coordinate well with current furniture (everything seems to be grey with nail-head trim!). They appear much more expensive than they are. They are a little firm right now - hopefully will get more comfortable over time. And unfortunately, like much of the furniture available today, the seat cushions are not reversible.", 
    "Ordered 2 of these chairs for my master bedroom. They look great sitting together with a small table in between. The chairs are the perfect size for an accent piece. They are a little stiff, but comfortable enough for sitting a bit. The color is nice, a dark grey and I love the linen texture. They look really elegant.", 
    "This is a great chair. It is a little stiff/hard but the softness of the fabric almost makes up for that. It fit perfectly in the corner of the one of my guest bedrooms and matched all the silver and other gray in the room. It seems very sturdy but I would be a little hesitant to use this with folks that are hard on furniture (e.g. kids that tend to jump on furniture). I'm not sure that the chair could withstand a ton of abuse. Overall I couldn't be more pleased!", 
    "I received my chair today and am pleased, with the exception of one very TINY detail I missed. Since the pictures didn't show a front view, I was not aware that the arms would be quite so thin (boxy looking), but I'm still okay with it. The silver tacking totally makes the chair, in my opinion, and really dresses it up. If you're considering buying this chair, make sure you look at the dimensions to make sure it is what you're looking for since it is a smaller chair. The size and \"motel like\" appearance doesn't bother me one bit...I still really like it.", 
    "love this chair! so easy to put together- neutral and sophisticated look. came super fast---very happy! slides so easy on wood floor though- will get stoppers for bottoms.", 
    "Chair seems very sturdy, despite the way it is assembled (the seat inserts into the back). We converted this chair into a rocker for our nursery with a rocker base and it looks just like the high end rockers that can go for thousands. Haven't used it for long periods of time but seems very comfortable for now.", 
    "If I had more rooms, I'd definitely more buy! I bought two of these for my lounge area and love, love, love them. Comfy, stylish and cozy!", 
    "I'm very pleased with my recent purchase of two charcoal gray club chairs for my living room. These chairs look great- they are really sharp looking for the price and the quality is fine for an accent chair that won't get a ton of daily use. The gray color has some green tones to it which was a surprise (I was hoping for a true gray or more of a blue gray), but it still works generally with my other decor.", 
    "We needed two smaller club chairs for a small family room where we watch TV, read and hang out. These chairs are good for an average to smaller adult and I've sat through several movies in them without discomfort. My wife prefers the stiffer seating of these chairs to our very expensive name brand down filled couch, she's 5'4\". A very large or heavy set person might find these a bit tight. But, we love them and they're good for wear/tear because of the darker fabric and they look 3 times the Overstock price.", 
    "The style and color of the chair is identical to the picture. It was super easy to put together. The chair is definitely small and looks miniature compared to other normal size furniture. Ended up returning it even though it cost $** to ship back.", 
    "The chair it self is a little light, but for the price it is a good deal and looks great. I must say I HATE all the railheads. I didnt realize the back popped in and they would be there as well. Too many and too shiny for our room. However, if it is going against a wall or chest and you like the shiny nail head look. You will LOVE this chair."
