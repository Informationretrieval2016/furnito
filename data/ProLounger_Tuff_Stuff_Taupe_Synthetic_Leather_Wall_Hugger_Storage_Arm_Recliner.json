    "Nice. Every time I sit in chair, I fall asleep. Lol", 
    "Love the built in cup holders and also the storage in both arms. Very comfortable recliner.", 
    "Certainly more grey in my mind than taupe but it worked fine. Right size and a breeze to put together. Will see how it wears and update this review then.", 
    "I liked the size of this chair but was very uncomfortable. I did not like the feel of this synthetic leather and it was so hard. Not enough contour when reclined, I needed pillows to have supports. The seat was extremely hard and took to much effort to bring down. Very disappointed in this purchase, I returned it.", 
    "couldn't be any more satisfying wood grade it a 10 out of 10 very happy with it Neighbours want some now", 
    "Just what I wanted for my Dad in the nursing home, just the right size for a small space and I love the drink holder and how the arms of the recliner lifts up so it can hold his Bible, very happy with this purchase, and delivery was great to!"
