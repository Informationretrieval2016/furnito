    "This bench is gorgeous...the fabric is just as pictured and great quality, The tufts seem to be done well, and look sturdy. The legs were really easy to put on with an allen wrench and are a nice rustic wood. They do not look like particle board or a run of the mill wood leg from a big box store. The size is perfect, nice and long but not too wide to take up too much space in the dining area. Love this bench!", 
    "It broke within 2 weeks of having it. A total of 3 people sat on it before the legs broke off. Not a quality item", 
    "This bench was bought about a month ago and we've had to make repairs to it. The bolts didn't stay tighten over a weeks worth of use. It's very comfortable, and the color is perfect. However two bottom boards have already broken and we've had to take it to a furniture repair person.", 
    "Do not buy this bench. It is not sturdy at all and will break if more than one person sits on it.", 
    "Bought these to use at my dining room table. Looked great, but very poor quality. Broke after 1st use with 2 people sitting on it. I was sent replacements, and those were even worse. One bench had 8 screws missing. My husband added screws to all the holes and it still broke after he sat on it. Literally sent him crashing to the ground. Very unhappy.", 
    "You are getting what you paid for. They look good and are pretty comfortable. Quality of workmanship is fair. Be careful of underneath as there are ruff wood edges and splinters. Very hard to put together and the instruction are simple but also wrong. I suggest you do #1, then #3, then #2. It will be a lot easier to put together, but still not easy to do.", 
    "Ordered Dark Grey Linen. Color is BEAUTIFUL. The tufts are great. Wood is a tiny bit veneer-looking, but only upon CLOSE examination. Very happy with the price.", 
    "I was hesitant to order furniture online but after looking in furniture stores who only offered fabric benches, I decided to take a chance. The bench is great. It looks expensive, well made and it was just what I was looking for!", 
    "We love the Tribecca Bench in the chocolate brown color. I gave to my wife as a Christmas gift. She uses it everyday!", 
    "Great addition to our dining room. Would buy again.", 
    "got the item in the mail and two of the legs were slightly different color than the other two. i wasnt going to let that bother me but when i sat on the seat it made a plastic bag noise. and the fabric was loose on the chair. i sent it back for another one and it wasn't any better than the first.", 
    "This was a perfect addition for extra seating.", 
    "Instead of 6 chairs I bought this bench to go with the Tribecca Home Benchwright Parsons chairs. It makes my dining area perfect! Now I want a new dining table!", 
    "Love the light grey color, looks great with my farmhouse table. Still have yet to put them together, so I'm hoping it's as easy as the other reviews claim!", 
    "Excellent product for the price. I assembled it with 2 bolts per leg in minutes. Very sturdy and nice thick firm cushion.", 
    "This bench was a Christmas gift. It was used by a 7 year old and a 5 year old girls. The leg snapped off the bench top. Overstock would DO ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AS IT WAS PAST 60 days. The excellent manufacturer would only offer a part - which in this case is the top - so they can now, on their own, attach all four legs THEMSELVES - KNOWING IT WILL SURELY HAPPEN AGAIN. Bad business policies and truly appalling customer service. You have lost a loyal customer", 
    "The bench is exactly as described. Very comfortable, very easy to install and looks very nice.", 
    "Loved the bench!!!!! The fabric matched perfectly to the key hole dining chairs I purchased.", 
    "This came in packaged so securely, and the assembly was quick and easy. Extremely solid and sturdy. I have seen similar examples of this at Home Goods and other shops but made cheaply, and definitely not as long as this one is. I am using it as a coffee table with a nice long wooden tray on top and it is perfect. I have the dark gray upholstery. Love it.", 
    "Just by looking at it the bench doesn't look to comfortable...but I was wrong it's very comfortable", 
    "Loooove this bench! The color is exactly as pictured. Was easy to assemble and seems sturdy. Received quickly. Would highly recommend. Thank you Overstock!", 
    "Works well and easy to put together. Nice modern piece.", 
    "I' m very please. I ordered beige color, just as expected. It's very comfortable, sturdy, well cushioned and tufted. Overall it's what I needed for my dinning room.", 
    "Easy to assemble. It's exactly as pictured. Very comfortable. Thinking about getting another one!", 
    "Beautiful bench, I purchased in light grey and it looks more like chambray and its very comfortable. Be careful though, because under the bench on the wood its not smooth so you can get splinters.", 
    "Rich fabric upholstery and nice color wood. Seems sturdy.", 
    "We love this dining bench, sturdy, large, well-made and looks great with our decor.", 
    "Easy to build, solid construction.", 
    "This has become my kids favorite place to sit and all 4 can fit. Perfect with my zinc top table. Purchased 4 matching chairs. Have had many compliments. Super comfortable. Easy to assemble.", 
    "Very well constructed, comfortable and beautiful. So glad I purchased!", 
    "just the right size and height for a bench at the end of our master king size bed", 
    "Make my dinningroom look very nice", 
    "Beautiful bench, bought it as a set with the INSPIRE Q Evelyn Tufted Wingback Hostess Chairs (Set of 2), sturdy feel, nice fabric. The assembly was easier than expected. All worth the effort as price and look were amazing", 
    "Nice quality for the price, and easy to assemble. Coloring was exactly as expected. I have no complaints about this piece...it was exactly what I wanted/needed.", 
    "We got this in the leather and are very happy with the purchase. Its very sturdy, comfortable and easy to assemble.", 
    "The bench looks as pictured and for the price is a great piece. Sturdy enough to hold 3 people if needed and looks nice with my trestle table. i got the light gray and it has a hint of blue to it.", 
    "I purchased this to go at the end of our bed. Purchased the beige. Color is true to what I saw on the screen. I was pleased with the tufting.", 
    "Exactly as described! So well built! Just stunning!", 
    "Matches the INSPIRE Q Evelyn Tufted Wingback Hostess Chairs (Set of 2) perfectly.", 
    "It's comfortable and gave me the look I www going for except the lags' color. They are too light but I'm going to paint the legs", 
    "Easy assembly. Great color and fabric light grey linen goes with everything. Love the verstility of these benches. Using with our dining table with the additional matching chairs. Price was right and with a little scotchgard they are holding up beautifully against 3 childrens daily use.", 
    "I love these benches. great look for the price. easy to assemble.", 
    "Although this is part of a dining room set I bought this bench for the end of my bed. I just love it! It is higher than your typical bench however my bed sits higher so it's perfect. Very well made.", 
    "I bought this bench with my 3 kids in mind, thinking that it would be fun for them to sit on at the dining table. Once I sat on it though, I was hooked. It is so comfortable. I'm small (5' 2\") and the cushioned seat lifts me up nicely, and it does that for the kids too, of course. But maybe because I have a bit of a back problem, but when I sit down on this bench, my whole body relaxes. The bench itself is lovely to look at. I chose the dark grey and it's gorgeous. The tufting is tight and elegant. It might be a little on the traditional side for our modern decor, but these days it's cool to mix and match. So I bought some modern acrylic ghost armchairs to lighten up the look at the table. I think it looks great. I love this bench so much that instead of buying side chairs for the other side of the table, I just bought a second bench. That way, the kids and I both get to use it and I want our guests to enjoy how relaxing it is to sit on them at dinner. Ps.. Putting the bench together is really quick and easy. It's super-solid looking and feeling but light enough for me to move around. I also love that it's light weight because we just had hardwood floors put in our kitchen and I never worry that the bench will scratch the floors. It has little plastic knobs under the legs, but I also put on little felt floor protectors just to be sure:)", 
    "Great purchase. This bench has updated the look of even our (new) dining set instantly! The light gray and distressing is perfect with everything in our small living/dining space. Easy to assemble. Safe and comfy for grandchildren to climb up. Fast ship.", 
    "Love the color and goes well with dining table and benches.", 
    "Love this bench! Very well made and super comfortable.", 
    "Perfect match to the Inspire Evelyn Tuft Wingback Chairs", 
    "Just received my bench and it's really well made. Doesn't wobble and is quite sturdy. The tufted seat is very comfortable and it's the right height for my dining room table. I purchased the dark charcoal grey and it works well with my walnut furniture.", 
    "I love the look of this bench. reclaimed wood is sophisticated. upholstery is neutral. It was sooooo easy to assemble. Lots of compliments on it. and a great price. buy it,", 
    "I'm a single mom of a 4 year old. This bench was easy to put together. I bought it to go with my dinning room table. It works great! The padding is very lux and it allows my child to comfortably sit at the table without using a booster seat. It's easy for her to climb up to and I can sit beside her during dinner and coloring projects. We now use our table for more than just a place to throw things. :).", 
    "Excellent bench, sturdy,well made . I bought the dark gray color and I really like it. Using for extra seating in my office but this bench would also be perfect for a dining bench.", 
    "This is a very nice soft gray that would blend with any decor. Beautiful tufting and well made.", 
    "great purchase for the price. Matches the inspire q evelyn tufted chairs perfectly.", 
    "I like this and better my wife loves it. Gray color is exactly what we needed. Aside from slightly off colors on the wood on what looks like smears of paint it looks great... seat padding is well done.", 
    "Easy to put together and very solid bench. Looks great with Renate dining chairs. Happy with this purchase.", 
    "I was very hesitant to purchase a bench for my current dining set due to the color/style of the set. I shopped long and hard before deciding on this bench. I could not be happier! This bench is beautiful, matches my set like it was a part of the original set. I get many compliments on this bench. Would definitely recommend!", 
    "This bench is great quality and better than I expected. I ordered the light gray and it is a beauty. The seat is very dense and the tufting looks very high end. I order regularly from overstock and I am really impressed with this. It looks great at the foot of my Cal King bed. Perfect size and height. It is definitely a keeper.", 
    "The bench is very comfortable can't wait to use it for thanksgiving.", 
    "Putting together was a breeze did it myself and looks amazing and you do not sink. Very comfortable", 
    "Just what I was looking for...sturdy, color is perfect, and wood accessorize other furniture. Also, easy to assemble. Thanks...", 
    "I paired this bench with a banquette and two chairs that I purchased from Z gallerie. It matches perfectly! Very comfortable and half the cost of others that I've seen.", 
    "Love this bench. I purchased the dark grey color along with the matching Rolled back parsons chairs. I paired these with a reclaimed table and looks amazing. Very comfortable. My husband assembled them all within an hour (4 chairs and 2 benches), he was impressed with the quality. Could sit 3 people on this bench. Great buy. Very pleased.", 
    "I have been searching for a loongg time for a bench to go between 2 bookcases and to fit under my window...this is perfect! Love the rustic look of the legs and the cushion is very sturdy and well made. I got the dark grey color and it looks great!", 
    "super cool - love the reclaimed \"look\" of the wood", 
    "I bought this on a Thursday and this came on Friday. Very quick shipping. 1st time I bought something from here. I love this beautiful bench and very sturdy , durable and comfy all in one. Great deal and just what I was looking for.", 
    "Good quality piece. Color is quite different than on line photo, however. We are having this item reupholstered to get desired color. Still, overall we are satisfied.", 
    "could mis with practically anything. had a great color and the wood was washed, and not too warm of a tone.", 
    "impressed on the quality of bench for price has held up well with two kids", 
    "I like the look of this piece with my dining table.", 
    "Exactly what I was looking for, nice item for the $$", 
    "Love this bench! Everyone asks where I got it. Very sturdy and comfortable too! Would not hesitate to purchase it again. A+", 
    "This is really a beautiful piece of furniture for the price. Not only do I plan to use it in my dining room, but also for photoshoots (I'm a professional photographer). My husband put it together last night and I couldn't be more pleased!", 
    "Love this bench! It's very sturdy and was a perfect addition to my bedroom. The price was great as well.", 
    "I bought this bench for my entry way. The top is well padded and tufted, exactly as pictures. Nice linen top. I wasn't sure what \"reclaimed\" meant but it's apparently a reference to the wood finish which looks like it could use another coat of stain. But not bad looking. Overall I am happy with the purchase.", 
    "quality not as good as we hoped...."
