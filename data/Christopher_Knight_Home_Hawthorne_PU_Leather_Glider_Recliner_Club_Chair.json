    "This chair is perfect! I'm a big guy and it suits me well. It was easy to get in the house. We have narrow stairwells due to the house being built in the 1700s. It comes in the box in 4 pieces that are SUPER easy to assemble. Just slide the wings on the back and slide the back onto the main frame of the chair. It locks in place and can be removed should we need to ever take it out of the house. Unfortunately for me, my wife has already taken it over and is comfortable passed out taking a pregnant day nap! Great chair and free delivery as compared to the local furniture stores that would want the price of the recliner plus $50-$80 for delivery.", 
    "Especially for the sale price ,this is a very good value. Firm, but very comfortable. Good for my bad back. Only one thing. I am 6, 4 inches, and this chair will not support my extended legs when in the reclining position. Something I'm learning to live with, but wish it was not so short.", 
    "Nice sized chair if you are over weight, easy to put up foot rest, but a little hard to close foot rest if you don't have the strength. Over all good chair and I would recommend it. But they sent me wrong color. I wanted a black chair and got brown. To much trouble to send back for the color.", 
    "Great great great chair . You won't be sorry .....", 
    "Wonderful in every way ! A satisfied customer ..", 
    "I had to call the company directly to have the right arm piece sent to me. It was free, but quite a wait.", 
    "Looked bigger on picture but I do like it a lot. Delivery was only 5 days. I'm a happy customer.", 
    "chair picture did look look a lot bigger. im about 200 plus and it was strong enough to hold me and did not fall back or anything. was hope for a lil better headpiece that would give it a lil more support. good as its going to get.", 
    "I love the recliner, it is so comfortable! I have degenerative arthritis in my knees and I can get up and sit down easily in this chair. Quality material and workmanship.", 
    "Very Good item. For the price, I feel that it was worth every dollar I spent on it.", 
    "I bought 2chairs, they are light, the bottoms are. Hard to kick in for me. Very pretty, but I would like a heavier chair. One chair seems to be easier to get out of for some reason. Over all I like the chairs", 
    "Sent the Chair with a missing part. I called and asked for the part to be sent. They sent the part . but it was the wrong part .", 
    "Love this recliner! It was easy to assemble, great deal for the price!", 
    "having problem with leg rest not working, don't know what to do the recline is real comfortable if only the leg rest would work", 
    "We received this chair during a doorbuster deal for a little over $$$ and it is an amazing chair for that price. It's firmer than it looks in the picture, but it's comfortable. We wouldn't have purchased this price at the original sale price but for the price we got, it was a steal.",

    "This rocker recliner was more plush than I expected. It came in a box that easily fit through the door. It suggested to have 2 people for putting the 4 pieces together but it was so easy my husband was able to put it together by himself.Terrific purchase!", 
    "I recommended easy to assemble cushioned is for a king.",
