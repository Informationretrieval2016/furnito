    "One thing to note: THIS COUCH IS GRAY, as pictured. We were not picky; after all, we're ordering a couch online that we never touched or sat on. We agreed before ordering that gray or sage green were both acceptable. It is a medium \"steely\" heather tone. The micro fiber is soft to the touch and appears it will be easy to clean. It shipped in one box, which was heavy, but manageable. The couch was super easy to assemble. It took less than an hour with one person. The directions were easy to follow, and it had a minimal number of pieces. We were worried about ordering a \"futon\" because they are so awful, and we thought we had finally out-grown that stage in our lives. With traditional futons, the mattress always slides around, it's lumpy, and it looks like a college dorm room. That said, we needed a sleeper sofa, and nicer fold out couch beds were out of our budget. The design for this sleeper is impressive. Two coiled mattresses fit inside of a pocketed \"cushion\" cover. When it is upright, it looks and feels like 6 individual cushions. We were concerned that when folded down, you would feel the gap between the two mattresses (or roll to the center). This was not the case. The padded cover conceals the mattresses very well. The sleeping surface was seamless and comfortable. It fits full size sheets, and fits two adults comfortably; but keep in mind, it is a full size bed, not a queen. This is not for two fat people. The couch, in its upright position, will accommodate 3 adults nicely, and that isn't squished or awkward. (its comes with a third, reclining position that seems pointless). An adult can lay on the couch and fit nicely; perfect for dozing while watching tv. The arm rests are a nice height and are comfortable to lean on or place a pillow against for napping. They also look nice as the \"head/foot boards\" of the sleeper. Considering that this is our primary couch, and not for a guest room or den; we are a bit concerned about how the padding will hold up with heavy use over time. The mattresses/cushions are comfortable and kind of plush. If they were more firm, I wouldn't be as concerned. We have only had the couch for a few days and love it; so only time will tell how it holds up to daily use. I would recommend this sleeper to others. The quality is more than acceptable for the price, and it is comfortable as a couch and a sleeper. It looks like a couch, and not a futon. One thing to note: All four feet were slightly dinged up, but it is easily over-looked.", 
    "I needed a new couch when I recently moved, but also wanted something my friends could crash on in comfort when they stopped by. I figured a futon would be the way to go, but they don't always make the best couches in terms of looks/comfort and my friends aren't here that much... So I almost bought a standard couch. I'm so glad I found this item. It looks like a high-end microfiber couch once assembled (more on that in a moment) and is extremely comfortable. Probably more-so than most other sofas. The color matches the \"O\" photo, it's gray with a very light hint of Sage. As a couch, I'm very impressed with the style and comfort. Nobody could ever guess that it folds into a bed. The seating and back surface is \"inner spring\" instead of pressed material (like a futon) so it's a bit more comfortable. When folded into a bed, it's like sleeping on a...well, a standard bed. FAR better than a pull out couch and even better than a futon. The only downside is that it is a royal pain to put together. The instructions aren't too bad, but they aren't great. The most difficult part is putting the cover on properly and the instructions are worthless for that. I put this together by myself and it didn't take long. If this is the only issue I can find to be negative about it must be a great product. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for style, comfort and price.", 
    "First thank you to all those who wrote reviews previously, it completely helped with us purchasing this couch. Color - Yes, the color says sage green. When I opened the box downstairs, it actually looked sage green, my downstairs has lots of earth tones and the green showed. I was worried about how 'green' it looked and it was going in my daughter's room. When we brought the pieces upstairs to her purple room, all traces of green were gone and the sofa looks gray. I would say if you are putting this in a room with earthy colors, it will look sage, if it's completely different colors, it will look gray as others have stated. Assembly - Instructions and all pieces were included. The instructions were ok. We managed to assemble in about 40 minutes, not too bad. They include all the tools so you don't even need your own screwdriver! Quality - The material is a very soft microfiber, hopefully it will hold up but the material seems nice. I don't care for the pillow pattern. This is NOT like the futons of old. We have one of those saggy couch futons from the 90s and this is nothing like that. It has a super thick coil innerspring which makes it feel very much like upholstered furniture. The case was easy to put on but we didn't let the compressed futon part expand. The sofa looks and feels like a sofa, not a futon. Some of those old futons had strange angles on the seats, this is angled like a sofa. Ease of conversion - This was the part I had to see to believe. Our old futon take two people to put down, more out from the wall and convert. This is literally a lift and click. It's effortless and you don't need to move away from the wall. I have to say the design is excellent and the comfort is amazing. Feels like a bed. Value - For the price of this sofa, can't beat it. We were at IKEA looking for a sofa and the one that was similar in look was going to cost more, wouldn't convert to a bed and wouldn't have shipped for free either. The only reason we didn't get it was because they were out of stock. It was a blessing in disguise, we have a better looking sofa, converts to a bed, got shipped to my door for free. We ordered late Saturday night and it was here on Tues, I think it shipped from SoCal though which is where we are. I recommend this sofa.", 
    "We purchased this couch in November 2011, and I've been regretting it ever since. The doorway to our new home was quite narrow, so we were limited in our options for selecting a new couch. This seemed like a good idea to serve the dual function of a regular couch and extra space for overnight guests. It worked better for the second function than it did the first. People didn't seem to mind sleeping on the couch, but as a functional piece of living room furniture, it was awful. The color shown on the website appears to be a neutral grey-green, but when we received the actual product, the fabric was closer to a pale green-green. Not what we were looking for at all. Additionally, the fabric was shiny and felt extremely cheap and unappealing to the touch. I was so unhappy with it that I wound up ordering a selection of slipcovers within a week of receiving the couch. The construction of the couch matched the poor quality fabric. I was surprised to see that the couch was made in China, and was anything but surprised to see that the quality of the piece reflected that. Within a few months of purchase, the seat part of the sofa started breaking down- you could feel springs popping and bending, and a deep canyon started to develop in one particular place. As the couch is inexpensive, my expectations weren't that high, but to break down that quickly with standard wear is inexcusable. I'm giving this thing away after a year and a half of use and encourage everyone else to avoid it.", 
    "Very nice couch that allows for extra sleeping space when company comes over. The unit is quite simple to put together; it says you need two people, but it is manageable alone. The cushions are springs covered in 1-2 inches of padding. This is not the most comfortable couch in the world, but decent for the price range and has the space saving benefit of being a nice guest bed.", 
    "I've owned this couch for slightly over a year. While I love the style, design, and function it is not well made. After a year of regular but gentle use the springs are poking through the bottom mattress and the microfiber has started to pill. Overall I'm very disappointed in the quality.", 
    "Pros: Couch looks nice, modern. Color is a nice neutral gray with a slight green tint to it. Cant tell its a futon. Lots of seating area (im 6''2\" and can lay down on it comfortably unlike my prior full futon). Cons: Microfiber cover stretches easily leaving sags and bubbles. Some of the hardware is less than ideal quality: Some of the screw threads stripped as i was assembling.", 
    "VERY pleased with this as a couch: not too deep a seat, good back support and the PERFECT height of the arms if you want to curl up and read. The microfiber is pleasant to the touch and brushes clean easily. Delighted with the ease of opening and closing! Also- nice surprise- extremely efficient use of space. Note: definitely not a single person assembly job. Downside: I've been using it as a sleep couch nightly, and sorry but it really needs something to fill the gap between the back and the seat when it's opened out. Also after a month, it needs a board underneath because the center is increasingly V'd downward. Overall, for the money, excellence of the couch & fabric, ease of opening to the bed, I'd definitely recommend it.", 
    "First of all, the color is per the product description - \"sage green\", and not the picture, although from reading other reviews before buying it, many people thought it looked more gray. I was hoping it'd be gray. Color is a little dull in my opinion, but a few accent pillows help to balance it out. I've had the sofa for almost two months now, and the center portion's starting to loss its shape. The sofa's still quite comfortable. The microfiber makes it a little uncomfortable to sit on when the weather got a warm. I think being able to have the sofa delivered to my apartment (whole another story - long one - in dealing with UPS on that) and the flexibility of converting to a bed at this price made me less picky.", 
    "Really comfy. Easy to put together and easily turns into the sofa bed. Would definately recommend.", 
    "My boyfriend and I have had this futon as our main (and only) couch for over 2 1/2 years now, so I thought I'd offer my two cents. We searched long and hard for a couch that would fit multiple criteria: 1. fit into the budget of two poor grad students 2. be comfortable for everyday use 3. comfortably accommodate overnight guests in our tiny apartment 4. look halfway decent. It wasn't easy to find something that met all of our demands, and overall, we have been really pleased with this couch. We sit on it daily, have had numerous guests of all shapes and sizes spend a night or five on it (it's lovingly referred to as \"couch bed\" because of its ability to switch seamlessly from couch to bed), spilled various drinks and snacks on it, and it's still going strong. Very recently (maybe 1-2 months ago), two of the springs sprung in it, which is kind of annoying, but also somewhat expected given how much use it gets. Also, we often lay a foam mattress topper on it when people sleep on it, which increases its level of comfort 500% - people have literally told us that they've never slept better on a bed that is not their own. In a pinch, people (myself included) have slept without the mattress pad and it is still sleepable, but the gap down the middle makes it noticeably less comfortable. We plan on continuing to use it until we move, at which point it'll find its new home in the guest room, because honestly, it's still pretty great for what it is and has a solid reputation round these parts. tl;dr This futon is the best of its kind and definitely worth it if you need multifunctionality out of your couch and don't have a ton of money to spend.", 
    "I just purchased this couch in October, and so far I'm not regretting it (which is unusual for me since I tend to suffer from buyer's remorse). It's very comfortable and is just what I was expecting. The color matches the picture - you can see a slight green tint on your screen, although that may depend on monitor settings I guess. It was easy to assemble as well. With the protection plan added, I think this couch is a great purchase.", 
    "First, a great piece of furniture for the price. Second, this is not green, as other people have mentioned. It is gray, with a slight green tinge. I do have to say that the covers for the accent pillows are horrid, but that's easy enough to replace. This is a great piece for those who want a nice couch, want something better than a futon, but can't really afford to get a piece of furniture that costs thousands of dollars. This is kind of in-between a futon and sleeper sofa. The wooden legs on the bottom really do a lot to make it look nice. The cushions are comfy, without being too hard or too soft. Very easy to convert from sofa to bed, and back again. Also very easy to put together, just follow the directions! All in all, a great buy!", 
    "This thing is great. Very comfortable as a couch and as a bed. It looks much nicer than the typical futon and only took an hour to put together.", 
    "comfortable couch, esp for price. Easy to switch between couch and sleeper. Color is nice - goes easily with sage or grey. Considering buying another one.", 
    "It's a spring mattress and it's firm right now. It wont be getting heavy use from me, so I expect it will hold up well. It will probably be decent nights sleep for a guest. All in all, if you want this as a primary sofa ... eh. You could do worse, but I'd probably go a different way. I did buy 2 extra pillows to make it a bit more inviting and I think that was a good call.", 
    "My number one complaint is that the cushions are too springy. After a week you start to feel th springs when you shift your body. You can definitely find a more comfortable couch/sofa. On the plus side; set up is not difficult, took about 45 minutes and the convertable feature is convienent and easy to use.", 
    "I am very happy with this product. I took a chance on buying online since this was for my basement. The only reason I won't give it a 5 is because it took me an hour to find one of the parts (center bar is in the mattress). It was reasonable to put together. Re: Color, the color online is too grey. It really is a sage green (Grey green). This couch allows me to sleep 2 more children or one more adult. Very happy and it's much more comfortable than I expected.", 
    "I'm very impressed with the look and comfort of this couch. Once properly set up (takes about an hour with 2 people), it's very easy to turn the sofa into a full futon position and vice versa. Very comfy couch and very comfy futon. I've personally slept on it, as well as friends, and it gives a good night's sleep.", 
    "Living in NYC, getting furniture in your house can be a challenge. I had to resort to buying this assembly required piece to avoid a repeat of an earlier delivery debacle and was pleasantly surprised. While hauling 144lbs up the stairs was no easy feat, putting this couch together alone was! It took me a minute but the directions were easy to follow with a minimum of screws. The couch doesn't look cheap as I feared and is very comfortable. The mattresses plumped right up once I cut them out of the packaging, I'm looking forward to christening it with an afternoon nap!!", 
    "The assembly of the product took a few hours. In my opinion, the how to assemble book should be revised along with their diagrams of the product. Some critical area drawings could have been larger. The comfort is like a counch. The color is grey green and works well if you have neutral colors.", 
    "We have had this futon for a few weeks now and we love it.I really wanted it for extra sleeping space.One thing I love is that it doesnt look like a futon,more like a sofa .Sits very nice and I love the color.", 
    "After a year of having this day bed I wanted to live the idea of a comfy couch that easily lays into a day bed for guest. But I should have listened to the reviews. The mattress is way too flimsy and broke through after a year of gentle use. If they sold mattress to replace it can easily be put in, since the couch is very easy to assemble. I have yet to find that option though. Also doesn't stay securely in place after its built so can fall apart. Beware.", 
    "Mattress is of such poor quality that springs start poking out within 6 months of normal use. No options for replacement mattress. Last time I purchase from overstock", 
    "You would never believe this is a Futon. It is the most comfortable sofa to sit or lay on and extremely easy to put together and operate. Takes about 30 minutes. The mattress is super comfortable and when in it's upright position is like sitting on a sofa. I purchased for extra guest sleeping in a room where I didn't want to have an open bed. Works perfectly!", 
    "We wanted this coach for the basement and didnt want to spend a ton of money and liked the idea of the bed conversion if the kids wanted to have friends over for a sleep over. Only after a few months the couch fell apart. The springs started to bend and sitting became really uncomfortable. Its practically impossible to keep the velcro attached to the back so the lining ends up sagging. And the back of the couch fails to lock back to a couch from a bed so I have to prop the back of the couch up against a wall so it will not tip back when sitting. This is a classic lesson of we should have spent the extra money.", 
    "This sofa was good for about 9 mos. then the spring let go. We called and we were sent a new spring to install.. It was a real chore to install the spring. It was never a good as it was before and about 6 mos. later the spring gave way again. We trashed it. I can't believe they are still selling it. Everything else I have bought from Overstock has been of good quality.", 
    "Loved this sofa when it first arrived, super comfy as a couch and a bed. But-- doesn't last too long. After about a year and a half it is very lumpy and not comfortable. Will be going on the curb soon. It is inexpensive but I would recommend something that lasts a little longer if this is going to be your primary sitting furniture. Your butt and back will thank you for it.", 
    "I ordered this sofa bed for my son because it came unassembled and could easily fit the entrance to his apartment. He received the sofa as promised with parts missing. After some delay in receiving assistance with this issue and being told that the replacement parts would take several days to arrive, I spoke with supervisor Suzy and explained that the sofa bed was needed for guests that would be arriving before the replacement parts. She was sincere and extremely helpful. The replacement parts were sent in time for the guests to arrive. The sofa is green. The throw pillows are a little scratchy and hard. The sofa is comfortable, looks good and was easily assembled. Good value and good service.", 
    "A good purchase for me, a poor grad student. Easy to assemble--I did it by myself without any trouble. The seat is a bit shallow, so having an ottoman or something would be nice. I usually have it folded down (bed mode, if you will) for everyday use because I like to lounge more than sit. The extra pillows are really a nice addition too. Overall I'm definitely satisfied. Also, FYI this couch ships in one very large box (it weighs around 150 pounds), so take that into consideration when choosing what to purchase. The UPS guy brought it all they way up to my 3rd floor apt, though, so it was totally fine for me!", 
    "One person put this futon together in one hour. I am very pleased with the comfort and look of this futon. It's exactly what I wanted.", 
    "While shopping for a futon sofa my biggest concern was about the space where the two halves meet. Who could get a confortable sleep if there was a gap in the middle of the mattress? Happily there is none when the futon is folded flat. And the mattresses have coil springs giving them a thickness and \"give\" that was also unexpected. My memories of fold-out sofas were of a thin mattress and knowing that it was only one night's discomfort. The shipping box is large and heavy, but the contents were well protected. Assembly was straightforward. I had no issues insertng the matresses into their respective covers--and though there was a caution that they would be wrinkled for awhile I had none. The fabric is nice to sit on--neither slippery or stiff. The seat back has two upright positions--straight up (normal) and another that is at a angle--good for reclining. The mechanism for configuring the bed is fairly easy to operate--and quick. When converted into a bed the mattress extends about 5 inches further back than the sofa--so the sofa can be placed close to a wall but not against it.", 
    "I bought this couch to use in an apartment that I am living in temporarily after my home was flooded in Hurricane Sandy. We wanted something that couldbe a bed too but I didnt want to spend a lot of money because I am not sure it will be used once our house is rebuilt and I really didnt want a fouton because they look too dorm-like. This couch is perfect. It looks great , its very comfortable as a couch (more so when in the reclining position) and it makes a great bed too. This is the perfect mix of fouton and couch and I highly recommend it!", 
    "The couch went together with parts and tools enclosed. We like the way it opens up to a bed. Very practical for a small space.", 
    "I was a bit hesitant to buy a sofa online but this purchase turned out in my favor. This sofa easily beats many of the in-store sofas that I looked at in value. The quality of the components are better than that of sofas twice the price. It is incredibly comfortable both as a sofa and as a bed. The assembly was easy and quick (less than 1 hour). FYI for those apartment dwellers on upper floors without elevators... this sofa ships flat packed in one ~100lbs package but if you open it up you will find many individually packed packages within that makes the task of getting it to your floor easier.", 
    "I am very happy with my purchase. I wanted a futon, that looked more like a sofa, not a futon and that is exactly why bought this and exactly what I got. The 2 pillows were a nice addition and bonus that I wasn't expecting. It took my friend 1 and 3/4 hrs. to put it together, which I could have never done by myself. It took some of his own tools, but wasn't suppose to, so everything didn't go quite right with the process. Overall, thought it was a great purchase and very comfortable and nice looking.", 
    "I'm a bit disappointed, probably because of so many of the rave reviews I read on this site. First of all, it IS much better than a traditional futon (ugh) so I will give it that! But to say it looks like a sofa is stretching it a bit. I would say it looks like a sofa wannabee. I've had it since Thursday (today is Sunday) and the cushions have not yet smoothed out; it says it should take from 48-72 hours so I'm still hoping. It's the wrinkles that give it that futon look so if that problem would correct itself, I think I'd be much happier. I do love the ease with which it converts to a bed and then back to a sofa...very easy compared to a traditional futon. And after sleeping on it, I found it to be comfortable, very much unlike a traditional futon (although I think 2 people sleeping on it may be a bit crowded) I really do NOT like the pillows that came with it. They are pretty ugly, in my opinion, and wish they could have sent something more tasteful. With that being said, my experience with O.co has been extremely positive in the past and I will continue to order from them in the future. Delivery was prompt (less than a week) and everything arrived in perfect condition, no damage, nothing missing, as I've read in other reviews. It was not difficult to assemble; my daughter and I did it in an hour (with her doing most of the work!) I do wonder about the long term durability of this product; I live in a studio apartment and am using it for a bed, and I'm hoping it will last, but am doubtful. Compared to similar retail products, it was much less expensive, but still a lot of money for me, so I guess we'll have to see if it stands the test of time.", 
    "Great couch for people on a budget who wish for their visitors to have a comfy place to sleep. Much better than an expensive and stylish futon, comfort-speaking. Only negative is how the cushions shift and don't seem to fill up the gap where the cushions meet the arm. Feels great as a bed, though.", 
    "Definitely getting your moneys worth with this couch!", 
    "I loved the actual color of the couch which was prettier then the website. It was easy to put together (my daughter and I did it in a half an hour) and the fabric is easy to clean (we got it for our dogs). Going from and from couch to bed is a snap. Comfortable to sleep on (just ask my dogs).", 
    "This sofa bed was a pleasant surprise. I would not normally buy a sofa without first seeing it in person, but I relied on the customer reviews and crossed my fingers. When I saw the box it came in I was so worried that it would be way too small. However, it was a remarkably efficient way of packing everything. Once it was assembled it was just as I expected...maybe even a little better than I expected for the price. Converting it from sofa to bed is simple. It's not all that comfortable, but good enough for 2 overnight guests especially if they are not very large people.", 
    "Read many reviews before purchased. The reviews indicated the color was a little more gray than sage and that is true, but was definitely a color that is acceptable. Was easier to put together than I thought it would be according to the reviews. No issues. Have not actually used it to sit or sleep, but am hoping it is as comfortable as everyone indicates. Definitely does not look like a futon of old. Like the looks of it. Wish the pillows had been more complimentary, they were very boring.", 
    "The instructions were missing as well as some of the hardware. We received the hardware within 3 days. Called on a Saturday and received hardward on Tuesday morning. Had to call Overstock customer service to get the instruction for assembly email in a pdf, which arrived within an hour. While the instruction could have been more detailed the Sleeper Sofa went together in about 2 hours. My husband tightened every conecting bolt and screw, even the ones that were preassembled. He was impressed with the quality of the constrution. The sofa is comfortable. Haven't tried sleeping on it but are expecting company over the holidays and I am sure that they will like it better than the old traditional futon we had.", 
    "I was looking for a reasonably priced, comfortable futon for my home office/spare bedroom. I searched many places online and was ecstatic to find this futon/sleep sofa. It is less a futon and more a sleep sofa - which was exactly what I was looking for. The price is right and the look and functionality are perfect! I don't expect for it to have a lot of wear and tear - as I am a single retired person. However, I have already had a guest sleep on it, who reportedly slept well during the visit. It converts easily and can be done by one person. My friend had no trouble assembling it. It is large and quite heavy, but two of us easily got it upstairs in pieces. Sometimes I catch myself lying on it and watching tv for a quick break - perfect!", 
    "I am warning customers not to buy this sofabed if you have a carpet. There is some type of red paint or tint on all four feet of the sofabed and it stained my brand new carpet. No where on the website or on the packaging did it mention this red tint and so I set it up in my new house on my brand new carpet and it left red stains behind. I will now have to get my carpets professionally cleaned since the stains did not come out with carpet cleaner. I just want to warn customers who are thinking about buying this couch, you may be wasting your money and ruining your carpets.", 
    "This thing was a huge waste of money and a gigantic pain the neck. It was a hassle to put together and then, about the third time I sat on the thing to watch tv, one of the arms broke. Then I had to contact O.co and try to figure out how in the world I was going to get this thing back to them. They were willing to give me a refund, but so what? It would have been a 2-day ordeal just to get the thing taken apart and boxed up and I would have had to pay for the shipping (though, O.co did say they would reimburse me). My advice: skip this thing. From now on, I'm buying furniture from local stores who will stand behind their products and replace them without hassle if and when they turn out to be defective.", 
    "I have been pleasantly surprised with this couch. The assembly was not at all difficult. In fact I did it by myself. The directions were clear and everything you need was there including the tools. It sits well and feels sturdy. The hinge mechanism works easily and as a bed it is much more comfortable than I expected. In short, I am pleased with this purchase.", 
    "We're very happy with this couch. It was extremely easy to assemble - took us less than a half hour. Our visiting friends used it as a bed for almost 3 weeks and found it to be very comfortable. One of them was six feet tall. We are very impressed with the size of the couch. It is long and roomy. Make sure you have plenty of space for this extra-long couch!", 
    "I read the reviews prior to purchasing this couch. My son put it together in about an hour. The color really is sage green, but it does come off looking grayish because there is a lot of gray in the couch, too. In bright daylight, the sage green shows more, in darker light, it looks more gray. I slept on the couch (without turning it into a bed, which by the way, is very easy to do) and felt it had a very sturdy mattress. I think the mattress will last quite a long time. I liked that the cover was basically a slipcover, and if the mattress ever did wear out, you could simply replace the mattress and slip it into the cover. For the price spent, you could not find a couch, let alone a sleeper, at this very low price. I am extremely happy with this purchase and highly recommend it to anyone who needs a large couch. It very comfortably sits 3 people, or 2 people and a dog (smile).", 
    "I bought this for my daughter's new apartment, was there to get it - and it had to go through a very narrow door, which wasn't a problem for the UPS guy because of the way it was boxed. This was a bit more complicated to put together than I thought, but I figured it out and was able to do it myself. It is both comfy to sit on, and to sleep on, and certainly doesn't look like a futon!", 
    "I have had this for less than 1 month. I was able to put the product together by myself in about an hour and a half. The list of items provided in the instructions was a bit misleading in terms of the number of screws and lengths. Some of the screws were already attached to the frames and not in the hardware package. There was also a mention of longer screws but I found them all to be the same length. Once I had all the items identified, it was simple enough to put together.", 
    "We purchased this sofa for a beach house sun room. It is surprisingly comfortable both for sitting and for sleeping. It was very easy to assemble and is casual and attractive. I agree with others who said it was more gray than sage but it works fine for us.", 
    "I've been looking for a sofa bed but didn't want to purchase the traditional college kid futon. I wanted one with armrest. That said, I received the couch in a big box. It was easy to put together (I did it myself and it took less than two hours) The couch is comfortable (on the soft side) and its good value for the price. The microfiber is soft to the touch and looks better than some microfiber/ faux suede I've seen. It came with two decorative pillows which was a nice plus. Only con though is that one of the main part was misshaped, maybe a factory defect or may have happened during shipping. I had to use pliers and bend it to be able to put the couch together.", 
    "love the fold down option, super comfortable and my dog loves it as well", 
    "This sofa is much more comfortable than I expected. We have had two guests sleep on it so far and they both said they slept very well.", 
    "a little confusing to put together but once figured out great results", 
    "Color is as in picture. Took a while putting together but woth it.", 
    "My sister took after I'd used it a couple of years.Still comfy and she loves it,", 
    "I have had this couch for about 2 years and it has held up nicely, even for a move across the country! The color is perfect for hiding any dirt that may accumulate, but is also easy to clean. My guests find it very comfortable to sleep on, in fact, I slept on it for a few weeks until my bed arrived and found it surprisingly enjoyable for a futon! My only con is that the kick board along the front seems to be bowing inward a bit, but this hasn't affected its sturdiness from what I can tell.", 
    "was better than I thought it would be and very comfortable", 
    "Very comfortable and easy to convert from sofa to bed.", 
    "Looks great like a couch, works great as a futon- perfect for extra sleeping space in family office!", 
    "It was so easy to put together. My husband and I put it together in 30 minutes or less. It's very comfortable and soft to sleep on.", 
    "I put this together all by myself, using the enclosed instructions, and the suggested video. It was a little confusing, but not that difficult. (I really think they reversed the stickers for \"Right\" and \"Left,\" since they faced backwards when I followed their directions. I ignored the \"R\" and \"L\" stickers, but the sofa has not fallen apart. Two of the feet on the sofa were broken, but I ignored that.I don't know what to say about the color. Khaki? Sage? Gray? Still waiting for the wrinkles to disappear.It is incredibly comfortable. If I could give six stars on comfort, I would! I just wish the sofa was a little higher, but it is not a deal breaker.I think I am a happy customer.", 
    "This couch hooks together which sounds easy right? Well it also come apart just as easy. The \"mattress\" also falls down in the back so you have to lay it down, take off the cover, fight to get the mattress back into place then put it all back together. I would never have bought this had I know what trouble it would be.", 
    "Great sofa bed. Would recommend two people for assembling unit. Keep in mind patience is tantamount to success!", 
    "Very comfortable just what we needed", 
    "Overall, it was easy to assemble and looks good for our basement. It is sagging badly in the middle when upright after less than a year of wear and tear from our 3 young kids. Would prob not purchase again.", 
    "Too big , not a nice color, heavy. Look sheap", 
    "Too many problems. The instructions were too damn hard to follow.. Once it was raised, the back never went back down, the springs poke and after a year of using it the foam separated.. now I have a space between the sitting and back space. Bought it bcoz it's cheap but I feel now that even that $ isn't worth on this piece.", 
    "I purchased this item for a bed room it is very comfortable to sit on. It is also comfortable to sleep on I would recommend for a family room or a den.", 
    "Great for guest room and company. I was sleeping on it every day for more than a month and began to feel coil springs, but the color is great and couldn't beat the price plus free shipping! I recommend this highly, just not to be used daily as a bed. Well done!!!!!", 
    "Very disappointed with this sofa. I bought it because of good reviews. There us a big hole in the middle. Tried to fill it with blankets and put comforters on top but still very uncomfortable. My dad did not like it at all. It does look nice but that is all", 
    "This couch is more on the green side. I got it to replace the couch in my home office that did not turn into a futon/sleeper and was hoping that this would be a good solution. It come in one box and is pretty heavy, so make sure you have someone with you to help get it to its final room. Living on the 32nd floor caused problems as I had to reserve the freight elevator just to get it to my floor. Assembly was easy. The futon in the sitting position is very firm. When I laid it out for a guest to sleep on (which happened to be the day after I assemble it), I found that I needed to put a memory foam topper on it, which I ordered in advance just in case. My guest got in the bed and when he rolled to one side the whole thing almost toppled over onto him... Maybe it would be OK for one person if they sleep towards the middle of the futon. Not sure how this will work out as a futon for the long run.", 
    "Easy to relax on. The pullout bed is great for unexpected guests.", 
    "Perfect for small spaces. And watching the online video did help to put the couch together. Also got excellent customer service when the slipcover zippers broke.", 
    "This was my worst experience with Overstock. This sofa is terrible. Packing is really bad, box was a mess and couch came in dirty with ripped corners. Pillow fillers come inside the seat and are terrible to take out, as they get ripped when pulling - and I was very careful. Overall quality is poor. Again, very bad experience.", 
    "I'm disappointed in this futon. The cushions are horrible, you can feel every spring.", 
    "I needed new couches for our 600 ft one room hunting cabin. I also needed the extra sleeping space without going the traditional fold out sofa bed. This couch fit the bill. We took them up to the cabin 5 hours away and put them together there. The instructions were easy to follow and the couches went together fast. I say couches as we bought two of them. I slept on one of them the first night and found it comfortable and certainly big enough for one person. I highly recommend this product.", 
    "It is a very confortable emergency bed. Very steady sofa. It is in my living room. I will recommend for a family guest.", 
    "It keeps losing it shape every time someONE sits on it, it sags to 1 side, it always looks uneven and disheveled, love the color but nothing else about this purchase was good, at all! In the picture it doesn't even look like a futon, it looks strong and durable..IT IS NOT!", 
    "It's more of a green then I expected but it's still grey. Easy to put together. It was my first couch in an apartment. Good for an inexpensive option that's better than a standard futon.", 
    "More sage color than gray - throw pillow zipper broke. Firm to sit on, firm to sleep on. Very easy to assemble.I like it.", 
    "I have teenagers that that open it to use it as a futon to watch movies. It always seems to come off the hinges and its difficult for one person to fix it. Both sides have to be perfectly aligned and then it needs a lot of force to click it back into place. Not worth the effort.", 
    "The box it came in was so compact it was well packaged. The picture instructions were clear and no tools needed to put together. High quality appearance and comfortable. Best decision I made....I like the ease of putting it in the bed position.", 
    "Actual futons are terrible. I believe the renowned comic Jim Gaffigan refers to them as \"like sleeping on a grill.\" Well, dear readers, fear not. There are no grill-like tendencies with this futon. It looks like an actual couch, feels like an actual couch, quacks like an actual couch. I also just got a kitten and the suede cover is remarkably forgiving. I do wish the color was a little more \"grey\" and a little less \"sage,\" but it's not that bad. It's also very comfortable and the bed it creates is sizable and fits two people comfortably. Assembly took no time at all and done pretty easily by yourself, but even more so with two people. The pillow cover texture took me some getting used to, but they're fine.This couch is perfect for your first apartment or library/guest room/poolside lounge with some plastic on top.", 
    "This couch was comfortable and nice for about a day. It is gray, not sage green as some other reviewers have noted. You could feel the springs when you sat on it. There was not enough cushion. It didn't hold it's shape either. After about two years it looked pretty dingy. When I moved, I couldn't even GIVE the couch away. No one wanted it. What does that tell you?", 
    "it's a couch, not very wide", 
    "I bought this couch based upon the reviews and my desire to have something for company to sleep on if they spent the night. This couch is both comfortable to sit and sleep on, easy to fold down and fold up, and very easy to keep clean. A little heavy once it is assembled I found that once you take off the cushions it is much easier to move. Good looks, if not exactly stylish, perfect for a TV room if you love to fall asleep watching movies. Great for two people and solid quality!", 
    "Satisfied. I searched and searched for the perfect futon for my new lifestyle and this one came close. The color sage gray was as expected and the material seems to be durable enough for my 3 cats to play and sleep on. Im a 58 year old woman and I assembled it all by myself. It was sturdy and roomy enough to support both me and my man.", 
    "nice for us , for everyday use , would not hold up", 
    "I was hesitant to purchase a sofa online even at the remarkable price. I found other comments helpful - especially regarding the color. The color is more grey than green but goes really well with my other furniture which are browns and greens. The sofa is amazingly easy to assemble - no tools required. It is also surprisingly comfortable both for sitting and for sleeping. It appears to be reasonably sturdy even though it is lightweight and fairly easy to move around.", 
    "Pretty comfortable. Instructions not clear, hard to assemble.", 
    "Worst couch ever bought. Not comfortable, hard to turn into a sleeper. Would not recommend for the money.", 
    "Was surprised to see the size and shape of the box when it arrived. Couldn't imagine it would end up being a couch. Went together quickly and is very comfortable. Good investment.", 
    "When the couch arrived in a box, I was a bit worried but 30 minutes later it was puffed up and looking great in my living room. The directions were a little tough to follow because they were only the bare minimum...but we were able to play around with it a bit and figure it out with just a little effort.", 
    "had it for over a year now in my vacation home. It is comfy and when an extra bed is needed, it shines. Can't go wrong.", 
    "I love it just as described super confterble", 
    "I love the sofa and it looks really good and nice and firm. Made of good quality. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because no one has slept on it yet so I cannot rate that. But it is a very nice couch to sit on.", 
    "And it already broke. We are not impressed.", 
    "Pun definitely intended. I bought this couch around Sept/Oct 2014. At first, I really liked it. It seemed like a decent buy for my needs. But a few months in, I could feel a couch spring, then a part of it just seemed to dent in and stay that way. It became lumpy and weird in places. Instead of cushioned seating, I feel every spring in it poking up. It's well on its way to becoming a torture device. This ouch is crap. Don't do it! If it makes it through the warranty, it will disintegrate shortly thereafter, leaving nothing but springs in your behind.", 
    "Where do I even start? I should have paid attention to the negative reviews because after only 90 day, I feel like I've been totally ripped off. Start with the quality which is really poor. There is not enough cushion on the seating area especially toward the backrest, so you feel the metal springs protrude which is definitely. uncomfortable. Also, the armrest is so poorly constructed that the padding fell right through the middle of the wooden armrest frame. Good news if you buy it through ******** *******, they have a quality assurance program that may reimburse you if you end up buying junk, like this. Even one star is too high.", 
    "Product shipped very quick and I received it in excellent conditions. The product was very easy to assemble, I did it in about 30 min. I find its style is very nice and appealing to the eye, it's versatility makes this product excellent value especially at this price! The sofa is very comfortable to both sit and/or lay down. It feels both soft and firm as it should be for a sofa bed. Very happy with it.", 
    "This was exactly what we needed for our RV. It fit perfectly and is quite comfortable.Great value!", 
    "I was looking for a sleeper sofa for my office/guest room and didn't want to spend a lot. I ordered this mainly for the color and price and crossed my fingers that it would deliver. I used a coupon and got it for under $400. I was thrilled to receive in only 2 days and with free shipping.I have to say, the color was perfect.. it's grey but also looks sage depending on the time of day. It fits any decor. It is one of the most comfortable sofas I have come across. My son, who lives in his room, has now taken over this room. He has moved his computer into this room and his friends seem to be sleeping over more. My son put it together and said it was a snap. Great value for the price.", 
    "Good value for the price. Very comfortable.A little difficult to put together,but in the end it looks good and feels good.", 
    "Great purchase for the money and fast shipping! The couch is comfortable and it was the exact color in the picture (greenish). It is fairly easy to unfold into a bed, which is also very comfortable compared to other futons I've slept on. Pillows are comfy and stylish as well! Keep in mind I've only had it for a few weeks so I'm not sure how long the quality will last.", 
    "Came the very next day. Nice looking and very functional for a sleeper. Glad I purchased.", 
    "The shipment is fast. But It took two adults over two hours to assemble with one connection still not working properly. It is not worth the price. The look is not as good as we thought. We wish we can return it, but we do not think we can put it into the original boxes and bags.", 
    "I had been looking for a sofa but had not found anything that met all of my criteria. When I saw this on your site I had to order it. It was a cinch to put together, you don't even need tools. It looks pricier than it was and easily converts to a bed. I am totally pleased with this purchase.", 
    "I was relunctant to order such a big piece of furniture online without experiencing the overall look and comfort personally but took a chance and am glad I did. The sofabed arrived as promised and after lugging it inside by myself, (strong girl), I started putting it together. I was surprised that it did not require any tools to start out with or that there was no suggestion of tools to be used and swore it would be a complete disaster and collapse before it even served its purpose. It hasn't yet and I put it together by myself a week ago. My only complaint would be the instructions or lack of. It seems that if you're familiar with Ikea products, THEIR instructions are superior to the ones received. No words, just pictures that you have to figure out what the illustrations mean as far as placement. It was annoying and a bit frustrating. After an hour and 1/2 battling 2 pounds of sweat and cussing the instructions, my sofabed was finished and ready to use. I've sat on it a few times and it gives good support. You do not feel like you're sinking in and it's very sturdy. I haven't slept in it yet nor has anyone but this will be used in my guestroom. Looking forward to trying it out. Overall, worth the purchase and the time to put it together!", 
    "As some people mentioned, this sofa is SAGE! I so wanted it to be gray, but it is not, so if you have your heart set on something gray, DO NOT BUY IT! However, it happened to match a lot of what I had in the spare bedroom where I placed it. It makes for a nice comfortable place to sit and read. It would be good for guests to relax and watch tv. It is very easy to convert; not too bad to put together. Again, as others mentioned in their reviews, the directions were pretty lame. All in all, it isn't bad for a SAGE colored futon couch.", 
    "The couch I ordered was suppose to be grey. I ended up with dark green cover for the couch, Had to buy a cover up for the couch.", 
    "I should have been leary based on reviews. The couch was difficult to assemble because the instructions were so bad and one of the main pieces had a bent steel end that had to be straightened. After assembly, it looked good and was comfortable but only three weeks later it is squeaking and showing signs of wear. Definitely not worth the price if you intend to use it more than once in a while.", 
    "Very easy to put together and very comfortable. Make sure you install the lower back support with the Velcro facing down. It does not say that in the instructions I got. Haven't tried the bed yet but it looks like it will be comfortable as well seeing there is no bar running across the middle of the cushions. Overall it's a comfortable couch, that looks to be a comfortable bed and even comes with some nice pillows. The construction seems to be very good (all steel frame) and should last a while. I bought the grey and it's pretty true to the color in the picture.", 
    "This sofa was bought for a spare room, mostly for the extra bed. It will not be used very often. I probably would not buy this if it was to be used on a daily basis. I would recommend only if someone was going to use the sofa for the same reason I did. I really like the color. It looks gray. It looks like it has green in it. Depending on the wall color. Very easy to convert from sofa to bed and back.", 
    "when I first ordered this item, I must admit I was hesitant...wasn't sure I futon was what I wanted for my living room couch. HOWEVER... when it came in and my husband put it together (don't judge me, lol) it was beautiful. It doesn't \"look\" like a futon. it's a light sage green/grey - very neutral but you can add a throw pillow or two and it'll match almost any decor! We use this every day - its very comfortable and so far durable! I would definitely recommend this product. If you're just starting out and this product would serve as both couch and bed....definitely worth trying!", 
    "We needed a sofa bed for guests and for everyday sitting use for the kids. We didn't want to spend a lot but also didn't want to buy a futon. This looks like a proper sofa. Style wise, it is fine given the price. Assembly was straightforward but required 2 people. Cushion was ripped when it arrived but overstock quickly replaced it. It is overall a good buy!", 
    "We purchased this for our office. So far so good, I would not recommend it for sleeping someone tall however. Also our full sized sheets were a little big for it so I don't think it folds out to an actual full sized bed.", 
    "This product sufficiently suits my needs. It has a decent style, look, and feel. My 10 year old uses it a lot and I had an overnight guest remark on it's comfort as good. It is right for the price and was easy to put together. I've only had for a month and a half, but okay so far.", 
    "We needed a convertible sofa for our office/guest room, and I wasn't willing to pay a ton of money because we only have the occasional guest or crasher. It is really easy to convert - I do it by myself whenever the need arises. It's also pretty comfortable, but I wouldn't want to sleep on it for more than 1 night at a time. Two slender people can fit on it comfortably when pulled out. It is also long enough to comfortably accommodate a 5'10\" male, although I can't vouch for anyone taller than that. I really like the color - it's very neutral so I could style it however I wanted with fun pillows & a throw. Putting it together was a slight challenge because the pictures in the instructions were deceiving and they were written in very poorly translated English. It took about an hour and a half altogether, including troubleshooting.", 
    "We needed something that looked decent in our living room with sleeping comfort since we have family members come to visit a lot and no longer have a guest room available. It is definitely an inner spring mattress which feels weird to sit down on at first but then you don't notice it after a minute or two. Its VERY comfortable to sleep on. Way better than an air mattress or hide-a-bed. In fact I'd say its as comfortable as our bed. Its also super easy to fold out. Takes less than 10 seconds. The color looks Taupe/Gray in out house. I can see that it might look more green depending on paint color in the room and lighting. If this does wear out in a couple of years as some others reported I will definitely buy another one. Its totally worth it for what we need!", 
    "The color is really a sage green, I was hoping it was more grey as some reviewers reported. Easy to assembly, converts quickly. Very comfortable and stylish. Comes with the accent pillows, a plus. Another great value and purchase from Overstock.com!", 
    "Bought this item to provide a place for our daughter to sleep and watch tv in her unfurnished condo until the moving van arrives from the West Coast. Having no previous experience w/ futons, we relied on Overstock Reviews to help w/ our decision, and we're so glad we did. The couch is very attractive and fills out the den quite nicely - doesn't look like a temporary transition \"fix\" at all. Color is a subtle shade of olive; blends well w/ earth tones. The micro-fiber fabric is not at all \"cheap\" in appearance. Hasn't been slept on yet, but is comfortable to sit or lounge upon. Assembly was not difficult - took my husband about 90 minutes w/ no extra tools required; my assistance was needed only to stuff the pillows and futon cover.", 
    "Too many guests; too little space. Solution: a good sitting couch that easily converts to a full bed. Surprisingly solid construction. Good instructions for assembly. So easy to convert-- much easier than the old futon I used to have. What's not to like? The color is a lovely sage. I'm going treat it to make it stain resistant for grandsons' fingers. We're thrilled.", 
    "This sleeper sofa opens to a twin. Looks fine when used as a sofa. Not the top of the line but is ok. Assembly went well.", 
    "The sofa sleeper is a good piece of furniture for the budget minded shopper. The sofa is priced well and is comfortable enough to sit and sleep on. I'll have guests in the future and needed something they'll be comfortable with.", 
    "Was lookign for an inexpensive durable couch that had the option to sleep people in our basement. What we got was a very nice looking couch with pillows, that converts into a very firm, solid bed. The cushions of this are actually 8\" coiled mattresses that slip into a padded cover. It gives a very solid and comfortable sitting experience for both of us; 5'4\" 125lb and 6'1\" 240lbs (won't say which one is my wife). Comes disassembled. Assembly took under 2 hours; instructions and diagrams good, all parts and tools were there. Have had couch for a month now; very light use, so cannot comment on durability.", 
    "It is a very nice looking sofa for the price. I agree with other reviewers that the color is actually grey, not \"sage green\", but I was ok with that going in. It is pretty comfortable I think and it looks nice for a convertible couch. Parts were labeled for assembly. Not the easiest piece of furniture to assemble, but still doable without too much time. I am very satisfied with my purchase.", 
    "Cheaply made, falling apart. Very difficult to move.", 
    "It took 2 of us 3 hours to put together but the end product is excellent. The color is sage, not grey as some people described. You cannot tell it's a futon, it is more of a couch look. That is perfect for a room that doubles as a den and bedroom.", 
    "I love this couch. I sometimes sleep on it instead of my bed! It's so comfortable, both as a couch and a bed. I love it most as a bed though-- which is great cuz it's a couch! Buy it!", 
    "It serves the purpose. I had a problem in the beginning because I received 2 left arms, but the customer care at Overstock sent me the right arm rest after 2 weeks. It was a bit of inconvenience, but I'm happy with their effort and feels much more comfortable shopping at Overstock now, even a couch. Once the couch assembled, it looks nice, and it works well as a bed and it converts easily. It's worth the money.", 
    "This couch looks wonderful, is easy to put together (about an hour), and is very comfortable. When all 3 of us sat down (with a combined weight of about 700lbs) it didn't even make a sound so it is obviously very sturdy. I hope it holds up over time, but since it will only be used occasionally it should be fine.", 
    "I like the couch for guests but we have not pulled it out to use as a bed yet. The couch itself is pretty comfortable but I always feel like I have to sit at the every back of it so I don't damage some of the springs in the front. Laying down on it lengthwise feels okay. Not the most comfortable but not uncomfortable. I'm happy that the cover can be taken off and washed. It was very easy to assemble. I'm overall happy with the purchase. It's a great alternative to the air mattress and doubles as seating during the daylight hours.", 
    "The pros: This is a nice looking sofa bed. The quality is quite good, the color matches the online picture. It was delivered within a few days. The cons: It took some time to put this one together (I have built so many DIY furniture so I wasn't expecting this to be an issue. Especially annoying was the part where you have to put the cover). The cover is the biggest issue for me. The sofa cover is not attached to the cushions. Not something I expected based on the pictures. It doesn't stay in place, and makes the sofa looks messy after you sit on it.", 
    "I put the futon together in a little over an hour, with just a little help from my husband. It does not look like a futon, it looks like a regular couch. I put it in my second floor office and it was very easy to get upstairs and put together in the room. I would highly recommend this futon.", 
    "It was a more complicated assembly process, but good directions and labels were very helpful. The quality of this product is excellent and it is the most comfortable futon I have ever sat on.", 
    "Great couch that you forget folds down. The springs are great and just tough enough. The sides are sold and look great. Everyone who has come over and sat on it is shocked that it came in a box and shocked that we built it ourselves. This is a great couch and fills the room nicely. Oh, and building it isn't so bad if you have a second person.", 
    "It is a very nice but may take an hour to assembly , it is very comfort , beautiful but we can't describe it as grey color maybe a little bit green", 
    "bad choice it looked a year old in a few days. cover didnt fit . it was just a really bad choice.. but overstock took excellent care of me with this situation", 
    "A lot of other reviewers said their couches are grey rather than green. The site picture looks grey to me, but my couch is definitely sage green. I would have been happy with either color in the decor of the basement room we put it in. I put the couch together mostly by myself. The instructions were straightforward to me. I really only needed another person to help with one step. Overall, I am happy with the purchase and will be inclined to buy furniture from overstock again in the future.", 
    "First of all I did not think I was getting it. I do not know my payment plan yet. The pillows are adorable also very comfy. Easy colors to decorate with and get along with any scheme. It is necessary to read instructions carefully. Face the couch and your right hand is the right side of the sofa. When you attach the long boards they should have a smooth surface on top so when you attach the middle support it is perfectly straight. I learned this the hard way. One thought for me with regard to those of us who move. It could be dis-assembled and then put together at your new home. Perfectly lovely.", 
    "I was a little disappointed at how green this couch looks against beige walls and lavender curtains. But, this couch is so well designed that we may well take it with us when we find a more permanent home (we live in an apartment). The couch is only somewhat tricky to assemble. Due to its bulky nature, it's helpful to have two people there when you're down to the last few steps. Even though its not a very grand piece, the design of this couch is head-and-shoulders above your average futon. The inside framework is identical to a futon, but there is an actual spring mattress that goes inside (which is quite firm, if you like that), with a plush outer covering that really does wonders for the comfort. My in-laws stayed with us for two whole weeks and were shocked at how well they slept. It may feel a little stiff for someone who likes super soft bedding, though. It will sleep two people, but be prepared to get a little cozy. There are a few reasons I chose this couch. First, I needed a couch for my office that would serve primarily as a guest bed. It needed to be compact: I have a very large desk in a somewhat small room, but this bed fits right in while leaving plenty of room for guests to comfortably maneuver the remaining space. Also, this couch is microfiber, which is a nice fabric for a couch/futon. I wasn't too keen on the similar chenille couches from Overstock. As a bonus, I now have a couch in here that takes the room from a bland office to a cozy, complete area. The only negative thing I will say is that the pillows are purely decorative. Invest in some nice guest pillows or you may be disappointed.", 
    "Awful quality, Did not last three months. Lumpy and cover did not stay in place.", 
    "This is an excellent value for the money. Construction is impressive, easy to assemble for one person. Heaviest piece is frame and mattresses which may require 2 people to move upstairs. I used my small wheeled handcart with no problem. Very comfortable either as a couch or bed. Two granddaughters slept on it for 5 nights and were very happy with the comfort. I bought based on the reviews that I read, and I would certainly recommend this to anyone who has a need for a sleeper sofa on a budget. Not sure how the fabric will hold up over time, but so far (30 days), it's excellent.", 
    "I bought this for my daughter and her husband. It broke in less than 6 months of normal use. It is stuck in the sleeper position as well.", 
    "The color is not as pictured - it's more green, but it looks great. The couch is extremely well-built. Easy to put together, with clear instructions. This is not a cheap IKEA couch. The only piece that broke was the included wrench to assemble the couch - I just used another one and had no problems. Very comfortable!", 
    "I was a little bit worried that this couch wouldn't fit through the door of my apartment. I live up a small flight of stairs and have a weird kind of corner unit. 2 previous couches haven't fit! My door is 31 inchs and the box fit through just fine. Everything came in perfect condition. My only issue was screwing in one of the legs - it didn't want to hold but with a little elbow grease all went well. The instructions were very easy to read and overall it was pretty easy to assemble. I pulled the box in my apartment, got out all the peices and was able to put this couch together by my self (I'm 5'2 and 115lbs just to give some context). Other reviews have this couch looking grey - I think it matches the sage description from the product information. I have a sage chair and ottoman and they match perfectly. Once assembled the couch is relatively comfortable. I think it will take some time to break in. My dog loves it :)", 
    "THE COUCH IS NOT GREEN (or tan) I WISH! I read a previous review and they said the couch was definitely tan. Either the tan OR green color I was fine with. While I preferred to have some color in our office (the green), I would have been okay with the tan as well but it turns out the color I would describe as a mix between an army tan and an army light green. Other than that the quality is amazing, especially for $***. Its exactly what I was looking for. We mainly use it as a couch for the office but have used it numerous times as a sleeper so far with great reviews. I love that when you convert the couch to a sleeper position it is centered in the middle of the armrests. Very comfortable and very glad I did not settle for the $200 couch sleepers I was debating between.", 
    "Liked the color, nice size and easy to put together. This is in our TV room. No one has slept on it yet but I think it will be fine. The price was very reasonable and I think that it will hold up well.", 
    "I've bought a similar sofa convertible futon on o.co 3 years ago. That's still intact and in great condition. However this couch within a month of its usage started denting in the spots I sit in. I'm a 127lbs weighing female. It should be able to with stand my weight. But wait, that's not the end of it. Few months of sitting on it, I've had lower back pains now to the point I need physical therapy. I no longer sit on the couch and I experience discomfort in my back immediately. Looking to get rid of it!!!", 
    "We're very happy with this. It's in my son's college apartment. The mattress has inner springs so its comfy for sitting and sleeping. It doesn't look too futon-y. The fabric is soft and a neutral gray-green, washable, and we all like the pillow fabric with some gold and gray tones. Easy to assemble and a great price. Best of all, for $48 I got accidental damage protection for FIVE YEARS!!!!", 
    "Great value for the money, comfortable and easy to assemble and use. Comfortable fits 3 people. Inner spring cushion is firm enough not to sink in. Even for a large guy.", 
    "I turned my husband's home office into a cozy office/den/guest room with the addition of this sofa sleeper. It was easy to put together, looks like a regular sofa, and easily converts into a comfortable full-sized bed. Great value, and the neutral color works well.", 
    "I bought this futon for my guest room. It looks beautiful not like futon but more like a sofa. It can easily fit 2 people. It's very soft and comfortable to sit on. We have not tried sleeping on it yet.", 
    "the side fabric does not fit the couch as well as it should. some of the \"cover\" shows what shouldn't show. sleeper wise, seems to be almost as comfortable as my bed. a great guest bed for two or three days. Easy to put together and to work the sleeper -- works like a futon. I'm happy.", 
    "I purchased this for a cross country visit to my child who had just moved into an unfurnished home. The package arrived as promised & was reportedly very easy to put together. I was truly surprised at both the comfort of the sofa and the comfort of the bed. It was easy to convert back and forth. the cushions are deep foam, so great support for sitting and sleep. there is no bar or lumps. I do not sleep well away from home and slept through the night on this bed this was a great purchase & I would highly recommend", 
    "After I ordered this sleeper sofa, I found out that Overstock was shipping it via UPS ground (shipping weight was 146 lbs - UPS ground's cutoff is 150 lbs.) So if you order it, you might have to be around to help the UPS driver - even more so if he has to climb stairs. Instructions are well written (compared to what I am used to). That being said, I'm not the most mechanically inclined person you would meet - but if you take your time and read the instructions and compare the illustrations to the parts in front of you, it's not difficult to figure it out. It took me a bit over 2 hours by myself - so plan on giving yourself at least that amount of time. In all, I am very happy with it. Definitely a great sofa for a low price!! Just be ready to put it together.", 
    "This sofa really is sage green, which is a light grayish green. We're using it with the Hills Mission style chair and ottoman with olive upholstery, which brings out the green in the sofa. Some have commented that the throw pillows are ugly, but the photo here on the site does not do them any favors. They're not black and white: the colors are cream, khaki, light olive, and black. I had planned, based on the reviews, not to use them but changed my mind when I saw them. My son put the sofa together with some help from his dad to lift the deck and back in place on the hinges, but it wasn't difficult to assemble. Having a rachet wrench and screwdriver set really helps a lot. The cushions started to puff up as soon as the cover was taken out of the packaging, and most of the wrinkles smoothed out as soon as the cover was on the frame. It does have a \"manufactured\" odor when the packaging is first opened, but ours aired out pretty quickly. We are really thrilled with the sofa. It's very comfortable, very nice looking, and just right for our small living room area. I'm 5 foot 1 and my husband is 6 feet tall, and we both find it comfortable to sit and lie on.", 
    "I am pleased with this little couch! However, I had gambled and lost in that I was hoping it was more grey but it is truly sage green. Green/grey. But it was close enough to work. We have it in our play room and it is nice and low for the kids to get on and since we didn't spend a fortune on it, it is okay that the color isn't perfect or that it is mid-range quality. And for what it offers, it really doesn't take up much space. I am very glad that I got it! It took my husband about 90 minutes to assemble. He is very handy but it was still a bit confusing.", 
    "Purchased this a year ago, to double as a guest bed and as a couch in our TV room. Review as a bed: We have a very small room, and wanted something better looking than a futon but smaller than a sleeper loveseat. This totally fit the bill, and was nicely comfortable. Easy to assemble (less than 20 minutes with 2 people) and much more comfy than the foam mattresses in most pull-out beds. And I love how easy it is to work - slide it out a couple inches from the wall, pull up on the seat deck, and voila! A bed! My husband and I have both slept on it quite comfortably. Closes just as easily if you use your knees. As a couch: This thing has gotten a lot of miles. We finally rotated the mattress just recently because we (and 130 pounds of dog) were sitting on it every day and the springs have died a bit. I can't hold that against it. The material is indestructible (see dog comments) and it still looks almost as good - maybe a little loose. Rotating the mattress was easy because it's not attached to the frame, and when company comes again we'll rotate to \"company side\" to keep it fresh. It's not a quality or permanent furniture piece, but a great and affordable temporary.", 
    "I was pretty hesitant to purchase a couch online, let alone a futon masquerading as a couch. But low and behold, this futon/couch is AMAZING! Took me about an hour to assemble it (received it 5 days after ordering it; came in one box). The directions were clear and straight forward. It would've helped having another person there to help assemble it, but I made do by myself. What I like most about this couch is how easy it is to convert it from couch to futon bed. It's been one of my only pieces of furniture for the past 3 weeks, so I've slept on it everyday. It feels like a real bed! I like that the arms on either side act as a \"headboard\" and \"footboard\" much like a well put together bed. The cushions are nice and firm, but soft enough to say they have a comfortable lounge feel. The futon cover can come off if you need to wash it. And I absolutely love how it feels! It's very soft to the touch. Only downside: I don't like the pillows it comes with. Kinda tacky, but hey, everyone has their opinions :P Also the initial smell kind of reminds me of a newly unpacked memory foam mattress. The smell goes away after a few weeks. Overall, I love this couch/futon!", 
    "I received this couch this past Wednesday, April 11, 2012. I thought that the couch would be more gray, but it's really green. I know the description says Sage, but the picture is of a gray couch and one of the reviews said that it was gray. It's definitely green. But this is fine with me. It's nice. It's soft, wasn't too hard to put together (took about 2 hrs with another person helping) the only problem I have with the couch is it has a chemically smell to it. I'm going to let it air, and hopefully this will cure the problem. The other issue I have is the couch back seems reclined all the time when not in the bed position... but maybe this can be adjusted. All in all I like it. And it was very nicely priced so if my 3 yrs old does something horrible to it, I won't be that annoyed.", 
    "I thought the couch was neat design and rather good quality for the money. Color is good- it looks green sometimes and grey other times, which is just fine by me. It is easy to convert to a bed and back to a couch. My only complaint is that the cover really smelled bad for a week or so to the point that I had a fan blowing the air outside. It has been a few weeks and I can still smell it when sitting on it, but it is no where near as strong as it was. A few days with the windows open should clear up the rest.", 
    "This couch is great for the price i paid and the low shipping. It does need to be assembled but that was not an issue at all. I did it by myself in less than an hour so if you have help it should go very quickly. It is very comfortable and so easy to switch to a futon. Perfect size for my apartment and my daughter to sleep on. Very soft material. Love it!", 
    "I recieved this futon last Thursday, March 22 in a LONG box the size of the futon. The box was pretty beat up however, the parts were very well protected. I had no defective or missing parts and my boyfriend put it together in 1 hour. The couch is beautiful and looks NOTHING like traditional futons. This beauty looks and feels like a couch. It is very comfortable. It is firm yet soft and the conversion from couch to sleeper and vice versa is seemless. I expected to be more gray looking from the reviews however it could be the lighting in my apartment. I can't tell if it is sage, gray or tan in which all colors work for me. The couch had a fishy odor however that odor has since went away. In my opinion, the pillows are unattractive but that is an easy fix. I would recommend this inexpensive, comfy yet expensive looking futon to anyone who may need or want extra sleeping space.", 
    "The futon was never very comfortable, but it was the only model that would fit through the door and down the steps to the apartment. It was serviceable, but that is about it. Then, a baby pooped all over the cover. The cover can't be washed and dry cleaning it will cost almost as much as the coach. You can't order a replacement part and since the cover holds the coach together, the whole coach is worthless. It is just stupid that you can't order a replacement cover. DON'T ORDER THIS IF YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT STAINS", 
    "I was surprised at the comfort and quality. This couch/bed has springs and foam. I have had a few guests sleep on it now and they all found it comfortable and it looks great. Exactly what I was looking for."
