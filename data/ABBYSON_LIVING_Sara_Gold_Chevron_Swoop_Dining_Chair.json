    "Using as an oversized office chair and its perfect. Seems big for a dining table and not comfortable enough for living area. Perfect for what I use it for.", 
    "Looks good in my apartment and a nice, easy to move chair for the space. Not super comfortable but good for parties and to sit down for a minute"
