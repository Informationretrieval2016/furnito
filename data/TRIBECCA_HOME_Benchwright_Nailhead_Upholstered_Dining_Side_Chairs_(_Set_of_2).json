    "I was looking at quite a few different chairs until these came for sale on Overstock with free shipping! I have a reclaimed wood dining table for 6 from Restoration Hardware. I bought 6 of the light grey linen and absolutely love them! The color is really nice grey neutral with linen texture. The wood legs match my table, which was important to me. They delivered within 2 days, nicely packaged with 2 per box. I was able to put them together myself in an afternoon. I used a power drill instead of the supplied metal wrench which cut down on time. The seat is quite upright and the cushions are thick and firm, yet comfortable. I really enjoy the nailhead detail as well. These chairs really took the look of my dining area to a new level! Very pleased.", 
    "Okay for the price, arrived with a split leg, but Customer Service was very helpful in replacing the damaged leg.", 
    "We have young children. We wanted a nice look without breaking the bank! Used scotchgard to protect the seats. No problem so far. Works with our eclectic look. There are some strings that come out on the sides of the chairs but can be easily fixed.", 
    "exceeded my expectations. I purchased the gray linen chairs and the color is absolutely perfect. Easy to assemble and lightweight", 
    "fast shipping, comfortable and great quality", 
    "PRO: Look even nicer in personCON: Arrived in a box and needed to be assembled which was surprising but it only took w few minutes", 
    "Super comfy...true to color", 
    "these chairs are very nice", 
    "The chairs are very beautiful, comfortable, sturdy and very easy to install. You just need to connect the front two legs with the base and the base with the back.", 
    "Easy to assemble my 16 year old daughter and I put together all 8 chairs .all are sturdy and beautiful. Made my farm table look perfect. I love them. Would recommend them to anyone thinking about it.i bought the beige linen color, leg color is light washed wood everyone loves them . Wow", 
    "These chairs are just beautiful. We ordered the dark grey and they look wonderful paired with our french dining table. They are really good quality, 9 bolts in each chair so they are very sturdy. Definitely a great purchase!", 
    "The chairs look really nice but I decided to return them after seeing that the bench I bought from the same company broke", 
    "These chairs are beautiful. Very well made, sturdy yet super comfortable. The beige linen upholstery is exactly the color of the photo and the wood is a neutral shade with dark edges that goes very nicely with my dark oak round antique claw-foot table. They weren't difficult at all to put together, just a bit time consuming. All by myself it took about a half hour a chair, but they are well worth everyminute. Each chair would cost 2-3 times as much in a furniture store.", 
    "I ordered one pair from Overstock, which were much easier to assemble than the two I purchased from Amazon. Wood was NOT warped; all screws matched where holes were properly drilled (unlike Amazon's). My single complaint is that the red bag of screws had broken in packing or shipment, and there were some scratches and an indentation on one of the two leather chair seats from a run-away long screw. I fixed the scratches, and I think the groove will fill out with time.Otherwise, these are very comfortable, stable, and stylish chairs which match almost any decor. The legs are a light ash color--tan with grey distressing, and look fantastic with my dark oak table! I love the contrast between the dark brown leather and the light-colored wood. Overstock, you have done it again. Thanks!", 
    "I ordered two sets to go with my farm table and they look great! It took about an hour to assemble all four chairs. The only downside was some of the pre drilled holes were a little finicky and I had to enlist my husband to help get the screws in. I was worried the beige color would have a yellow undertone like other chairs I saw but it's an oatmeal colored beige. Overall the chairs appear to be all made and the cushions are nice and firm.", 
    "Perfect with my zinc top table.", 
    "One of the four chairs arrived with a cracked leg,customer service sent a replacement but it took over a week. Otherwise the chairs are sturdy, covered in thick soft leather, and wood that looks well weathered. I may order more in the future but wouldnt do it with any sort of time constraints as I might once again need customer service intervention.", 
    "Sent these chairs to my Daughter and Son-in Law. Then visited and I they look great and are extremely comfortable!", 
    "Love them. Very comfortable. Light. Easy to pick up for cleaning. The look is great. Could not be happier.", 
    "These came to my house quickly and were perfect! They are comfy and look much more expensive than they are. I am thinking about buying two more!", 
    "Since I ordered these with a coupon, they were a fantastic price for 4 chairs of pretty decent quality. The fabric looks a little cheap, but the color is nice (grey) and so is the nail head detail (although some are not equally spaced). They were easy for my boyfriend to assemble. One leg has a chip out of it, but it would be too much of a hassle to exchange.", 
    "The chairs look terrific in my dining room, updating an older, more formal wood table to a great contemporary look. They are well padded and comfortable to sit on. The legs are more distressed looking than in the photos. They are not super heavy but I see that as a bonus. May need to be tightened occasionally but overall we're thrilled with the affordable transformation of our room.", 
    "Beautiful! Comfortable! Highly recommend.", 
    "These are very well made and are a nice addition to the dining room. Bought them in grey with the weathered grey/brown wood finish. Very Pottery Barn and they sit very comfortably.", 
    "They have a moldy smell that still lingers but they look perfect so I have sprayed them with Lysol and scotch guarded them several times. most of them have gotten better but still not 100% I would not have found this look at this great price anywhere so I kept them.", 
    "They look great with our new dining room table. Would definitely recommend the power screwdriver to put together, you will need an alan wrench adapter. Great price, the leather and nailhead details are gorgeous!!", 
    "Great chairs, easy to put together and very comfortable. Not too big or bulky, which was exactly what I was looking for.", 
    "Beautiful, easy to assemble, quality and I LOVE the way they look. Have a factory smell to them right out of the box but that dissipates in about a week and they are perfect!", 
    "They did need to be assembled, but it was fairly easy. They are very nice and the right size for my area. Seating is comfortable. The drawback is they are not as heavy as I would like them to be. Otherwise great chair.Im happy with purchase.", 
    "My husband is very critical of chairs because he is a big football player dude. He likes these big seats- they are girthy and firmly cushioned. The detail of the nail heads and the white-washed wooded legs are a very organic, contemporary look!", 
    "I impressed myself because I put them together! I love the distressed wood on the legs - cushions are nice and firm - good support and they look great!", 
    "I was nervous about buying this before seeing in person, but I really do love them!", 
    "Nicer than I expected. Easy to assemble. I bought the light beige so bought Scotchguard to spray on the fabric. Wanted the dark gray but they were sold out\ud83d\ude02 Comfortable & firm seats. Go great with our farmhouse table!", 
    "Quality not as good as we hoped...", 
    "Great chairs!! Love the design!", 
    "Best dining chairs I have ever owned and awesome price! Cannot find anything better for the price. Very very pleased with the purchase. Quality built with strong bolts that took less than 1 hr to assemble all four. All the material and tools needed are included.", 
    "Ordered dark grey linen. Love these chairs. They are sturdy, good-sized and look GREAT! The furniture nails are good quality (don't look plastic-y at ALL). Good chair."
